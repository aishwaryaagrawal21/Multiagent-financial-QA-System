"Nvidia (NVDA), a giant in data centers and gaming, is supercharging investor interest in artificial intelligence. Is Nvidia stock a buy?

X

Semiconductor, AI News

On Dec. 6, AMD (AMD) released a new AI chip, offering new competition to Nvidia in the huge, fast-growing market.

In November, Nvidia delivered another quarterly earnings beat-and-raise report. It also unveiled the H200, its latest graphics processing unit for training AI models.

The AI chip leader has suffered recently from reports that the U.S. will move to crack down on redesigned Nvidia AI (artificial intelligence) chips, which were intended to get around export controls.

Companies like Nvidia, AMD and Microsoft (MSFT) tap the emerging market for generative AI. Generative AI can create content, including written articles, from simple phrases by analyzing vast amounts of data. It can also write programming code.

For those looking for the top large-cap stocks to buy now, here's a dive into NVDA.

Nvidia Stock Technical Analysis

The AI chip leader broke out past a 476.09 buy point from a double-bottom base in early November, reaching a record 505.48 on Nov. 20. However, the advance from the Oct. 31 low came on light volume, the IBD MarketSmith chart shows.

The stock stumbled after Nvidia's Nov. 21 earnings report, falling back below the buy point and 21-day line. But it has found recent support at the 50-day line.

If NVDA stock gets back above the entry, the buy zone would go to 499.89, according to IBD Leaderboard.

Nvidia stock tested the still-valid 476.09 buy point on Dec. 8, but closed below it.

The relative strength line for Nvidia stock is starting to show some lag after rallying for most of 2023. A rising RS line, the blue line in IBD charts, shows that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500.

After a painful 2022, NVDA stock has soared more than 223% year to date. It mostly held up better than growth stocks at large during recent market sell-offs.

Nvidia joined IBD Leaderboard after gapping up on earnings in February.

NVDA earns an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. In other words, Nvidia stock is in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of technical and fundamental metrics.

Investors generally should focus on stocks with Comp Ratings of 90 or even 95 and above. Nvidia stock often earns a spot on the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and Sector Leaders lists.

The IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that NVDA carries a Relative Strength Rating of 97. That means it has outperformed 97% of all other stocks over the past year.

The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) holds both Nvidia stock and AMD stock.

Out of 54 analysts covering NVDA stock, 51 rate it a buy. Three have a hold and no one has a sell, according to FactSet.

Looking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners? Start With These 3 Steps

NVDA Backstory, Rivals

The fabless chipmaker pioneered graphics processing units, or GPUs, to make video games more realistic. It's expanding in AI chips, used in supercomputers, data centers and drug development.

Nvidia's GPUs act as accelerators for central processing units, or CPUs, made by other companies. It's working on ""supercomputers"" combining its own CPUs and GPUs.

In addition, Nvidia chips are used for Bitcoin mining and self-driving electric cars.

Nvidia has made a big push into metaverse applications.

Fabless chip stocks include Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).

Currently, the fabless group ranks No. 92 out of 197 industry groups. Fabless companies design the hardware while outsourcing the manufacturing to a third-party firm.

For the best returns, investors should focus on companies that are leading the market and their own industry group.

Is Nvidia Stock A Buy?

On a fundamental level, Nvidia is poised for explosive growth. Earnings should more than triple this fiscal year, driven by booming chip sales for data centers and artificial intelligence.

The fabless chipmaker is expanding in other growth areas, such as automated electric cars, cloud gaming and the metaverse as well.

But AI competition is intensifying. Macroeconomic uncertainties linger. Geopolitical risks are also rife, from the U.S.-China trade war to actual war in Ukraine and Israel.

NVDA stock has staged a massive comeback, more than tripling in 2023 so far. Nvidia came under pressure after its latest earnings report. Shares are now rebounding from a key level, with the AI chip stock flirting with the buy point again.

Bottom line: Nvidia stock is not a buy right now, but it could be soon. As a chip company with exposure to top growth markets, NVDA is always one to watch.

"Blue Tower Asset Management, an investment Management Company, released its third quarter, 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the quarter, the Blue Tower Global Value had a -2.19% return net of fees (-1.94% gross). The rates on US government treasuries rose sharply this quarter as the Federal Reserve pushed back their predictions for interest rate decreases.

Blue Tower Asset Management made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""In addition to the use of larger datasets, the training speed of AI models has increased dramatically. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock almost tripled in the first 3 quarters of this year with a 197% gain, and a large reason for this is the huge role they have played in recent AI improvements. Nvidia’s single GPU AI training speed performance has increased by a dramatic 1000x in 10 years with only 2.5x coming from Moore’s Law3 driven increases in chip density. Besides better chip manufacturing, there were three other improvement factors at play: simplifications in number representation for the weights of the neural networks, more complex mathematical instructions for reducing the computational overhead involved in mathematical calculations, and increased neuron sparsity (in neural networks, some neurons are useless and can be pruned from the network without reducing performance significantly). In addition to these single GPU improvements, Nvidia also made improvements in data center scale architecture that allows groups of GPUs to work more efficiently together. It is noteworthy that the vast majority of the improvement came from hardware architectural and software data improvements, rather than transition density. These improvements were likely the low-hanging fruit of training speed improvements as researchers will eventually converge on an ideal architecture. The simplification of going from 32-bit to 8-bit floating point numbers for measuring weights is a one-time gain that can’t be repeated again. I expect the rate of improvement to slow down over the next ten years and eventually approach the levels of Moore’s Law improvements in chip efficiency. The historical trend for computer hardware is for it to eventually be commoditized, and I believe this will eventually occur for Nvidia’s GPUs as well.""

"Can they beat expectations again?

Nvidia is set to report quarterly earnings on Nov. 21 after the stock market closes at 3:20 CDT.

They are expected to report an earnings-per-share (EPS) of $3.39 on $16.11 billion in revenue.

The EPS figure is significantly higher this quarter compared to last quarter's expectation of $2.07 per share.

The revenue figure is significantly higher this quarter compared to last quarter's expectation of $11.09 billion.

Nvidia earnings preview

If you're reading this article, you probably already know that Nvidia (NVDA) has had a stellar 2023. The tech stock opened the year at $210.00, and reached its new all time high of $504.60 today, Nov. 20.

Nvidia has been the darling of the artificial intelligence craze, spiking almost $100 after their earnings announcement in May 2023. The stock has rallied almost $100 this month alone, and there are big expectations for the stock this earnings season. I was shocked to see just how much the EPS and revenue figures have increased compared to last quarter.

The current EPS expectation of $3.39 is over 50% higher than the previous quarter's expectation of $2.07 per share.

The current revenue expectation of $16.11 billion is also almost 50% higher than the previous quarter's expectation of $11.09 billion. Just staggering numbers from the chip maker, and it seems as though they'll need to exceed these numbers yet again and post a strong guidance for next year if they want to keep this stock price sky high.

The stock price's expected move through this week based on current implied volatility is +-$37.64, which is just over 7% of the current stock price. This is a pretty large expected move for such a high-priced stock. This weekly expected move makes up over 50% of the expected move through the January 2024 monthly cycle, so there is a lot of market movement expected from this earnings announcement alone.

Bullish on NVDA stock for earnings

It's no surprise to see NVDA going straight to the moon after the surge of AI demand, and the expectation is that earnings will be very impressive this quarter. If that rings true, and they announce strong expectations for things to continue into next year, we could see little bearish resistance and the stock move higher.

Bearish on NVDA stock for earnings

Interestingly enough, it seems there is a lot of fear for downside movement this earnings quarter. At the end of the day, a massive increase in EPS and revenue expectations puts pressure on the company to deliver and paint a positive light. If they miss at all, or exhibit weak guidance for future quarters, we could easily see ""profit taking"" and long positions closed, which could put downside pressure on the stock.

There is still some turbulence in the sales relationship with China, which NVDA is closely tied to. This adds a layer of complexity to things, but negative political press is usually not good for single name equities regardless of who they are or what they produce. If there is shakiness on the earnings call, we could see the stock move lower.

"In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. A deeper analysis suggests a bullish view for NVIDIA and a bearish view for AMD.

NVIDIA develops graphics processing units (GPUs) semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, creative design, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, AMD designs processors and related technologies for AI, data centers, gaming, and business-computing applications.

Shares of NVDA are up 240% year-to-date. Meanwhile, AMD stock has gained 93% year-to-date, including a 20% return over the last three months.

Despite NVIDIA’s much higher gains this year, it’s trading at a much lower valuation than AMD. We’ll look at their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is currently trading at a P/E of 46.4 versus its three-year average P/E of 29.9.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)

At a P/E of around 64.3, NVIDIA is trading at a relatively small premium to its industry (compared to AMD’s premium anyway). In fact, the stock hasn’t been this cheap in a year, and its long-term gains also suggest a bullish view might be appropriate despite the tremendous year-to-date gain.

On a P/E basis, NVIDIA hasn’t been this cheap since December 2022. In fact, NVIDIA was trading at a P/E of over 100 just days ago — before the last earnings report. Of course, significantly higher earnings send a company’s P/E much lower if its stock price doesn’t change dramatically.

In NVIDIA’s case, its earnings exploded so much higher year-over-year that its P/E was cut nearly in half after just a small pullback from around $500 a share on November 22 to $489 on November 24. For its third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.02 per share on $18.1 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of $3.37 per share on $16.2 billion in revenue.

Story continues

On a comparative basis, NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, while its adjusted earnings rose nearly sevenfold year-over-year and 49% quarter-over-quarter. The chipmaker’s GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings rose more than 13 times from a year ago to $3.71 per share, also demonstrating exploding growth.

Before that earnings report, NVIDIA shares had soared to a record high of around $505 with a P/E of about 120 in November. Normally, I wouldn’t suggest a bullish view of a stock that has risen so much, so fast.

However, once the market recognizes its lower valuation — and recovers from management’s warning about significantly lower sales to China and other countries due to export restrictions — NVIDIA shares will likely continue their tear. Despite that warning, the chipmaker still guided for almost 231% revenue growth to $20 billion in the fourth quarter, so it clearly isn’t all that worried.

Even if the stock doesn’t recover dramatically in the near term, NVIDIA’s long-term stock-price gains of 267% over the last three years, 1,184% over the last five, and 13,066% over the last 10 provide some level of safety over the long term. In fact, I would use any near-term pullbacks to add to the position.

What is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?

NVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $660.39, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies upside potential of 36.7%.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)

At a P/E of 1,120, Advanced Micro Devices has the opposite problem of NVIDIA. Its valuation has skyrocketed because it’s now barely profitable. However, the chipmaker certainly isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so it’s only a matter of time before it bounces back. For now, though, a bearish view seems appropriate, pending a better entry price or improved earnings numbers.

In the third quarter, AMD reported $299 million in GAAP net income, although that was an improvement from net income of $66 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company’s net income rose 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. AMD also reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the quarter, up from $5.6 billion a year ago.

Unfortunately, AMD continues to play catch-up to NVIDIA in the area of artificial intelligence, although management did reveal some progress on its last earnings call, announcing improvements in the company’s AI software capabilities through R&D and acquisitions. Management also expects the MI300 data center chip, which will support AI models, to be “the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.” In short, AMD will likely catch up to NVIDIA at some point, but we’re not there yet.

What is the Price Target for AMD Stock?

Advanced Micro Devices has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $126.79, the average AMD stock price target implies upside potential of 2.9%.

Conclusion: Bullish on NVDA, Bearish on AMD

The battle between NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices has been going on for years, with one company pulling out in front of the other and then the other catching up and trading places. Nonetheless, neither of these companies is going anywhere anytime soon.

However, AMD could be playing catch-up to NVIDIA on AI for some time, calling for a wait-and-see approach. Meanwhile, NVIDIA will likely rerate higher once the market digests management’s warning about the new export restrictions.

"Artificial-intelligence chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) late Tuesday smashed Wall Street's targets for its fiscal third quarter thanks to massive growth in sales of AI processors for data centers. It also guided higher than views for the current quarter. But NVDA stock fell in extended trading.

X

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted $4.02 a share on sales of $18.12 billion in the quarter ended Oct. 29. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Nvidia earnings of $3.37 a share on sales of $16.19 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Nvidia earnings rocketed 593%, while sales soared 206%.

Nvidia's Q3 report marked its second consecutive quarter of triple-digit percentage growth in sales and earnings thanks to white-hot demand for its processors for AI applications.

In the third quarter, Nvidia's data center sales jumped 279% from the year-earlier period to a record $14.51 billion. Data center sales increased 41% from the second quarter.

NVDA Stock Dips After Report

For the current quarter, Nvidia forecast sales of $20 billion, up 231% from the prior year. Analysts had been modeling sales of $17.96 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter ending in January.

In after-hours trading on the stock market today, NVDA stock slid 1% to 494.27. During the regular session Tuesday, NVDA stock declined 0.9% to close at 499.44.

""Our strong growth reflects the broad industry platform transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI,"" Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a news release.

""Large language model startups, consumer internet companies and global cloud service providers were the first movers, and the next waves are starting to build,"" he said. ""Nations and regional CSPs (cloud service providers) are investing in AI clouds to serve local demand, enterprise software companies are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms, and enterprises are creating custom AI to automate the world's largest industries.""

Nvidia Is A Recent Breakout

On Nov. 9, NVDA stock broke out of a double-bottom base at a buy point of 476.09, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.

Last week, Nvidia shares rose after the company announced new data center processors optimized for AI. At the SC23 supercomputing conference in Denver, Nvidia introduced its HGX H200 AI computing platform and GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip.

Nvidia ranks first out of 37 stocks in IBD's fabless semiconductor industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. NVDA stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99.

Further, NVDA stock is on three IBD lists: IBD 50, Leaderboard and Tech Leaders. Also, Nvidia is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks that have driven the market higher this year.

"Artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) smashed Wall Street's lofty expectations for its fiscal second quarter and guided much higher than views for the current period. NVDA stock initially jumped on the news Thursday but its gains faded as the day progressed.

X

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company late Wednesday said it earned an adjusted $2.70 a share on sales of $13.51 billion in the quarter ended July 30. Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted Nvidia earnings of $2.08 a share on sales of $11.19 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Nvidia earnings rocketed 429% while sales soared 101%.

For the current quarter, Nvidia predicted sales of $16 billion, up 170% from the same period last year. Wall Street had called for fiscal third-quarter revenue of $12.59 billion.

""A new computing era has begun,"" Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in a news release. ""Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI.""

Nvidia Stock In Record High Territory

Record data-center sales drove Nvidia's quarterly beat. The company's data-center revenue increased 171% from a year ago to $10.32 billion in the second quarter.

At least 27 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on NVDA stock after the report. And three other firms upgraded Nvidia shares to buy from neutral.

In morning trades on the stock market today, NVDA stock rocketed 6.6% to an all-time high of 502.30. However, NVDA stock was up just a fraction to 471.63 at the close.

Three months ago, Nvidia stock zoomed 24% higher the day after the company posted a monster beat-and-raise report.

NVDA Stock Is On 2 IBD Lists

Year to date through Wednesday's close, NVDA stock has risen 222% thanks to a steady stream of AI news. Nvidia has emerged as a leader in semiconductors, software and services for artificial intelligence applications, including generative AI.

Generative AI can create content — including written articles, images, videos and music — from simple descriptive phrases. Artificial intelligence systems analyze and digest vast amounts of data to create new works. Generative AI also can write computer programming code.

""During the quarter, major cloud service providers announced massive Nvidia H100 AI infrastructures,"" Huang said. ""Leading enterprise IT system and software providers announced partnerships to bring Nvidia AI to every industry. The race is on to adopt generative AI.""

NVDA stock is on IBD's Leaderboard and Tech Leaders lists.

Nvidia Report Wows NVDA Stock Analysts

Wall Street analysts gushed about Nvidia's quarterly report in their notes to clients.

""Nvidia's epic print and guide two quarters in a row is simply unprecedented and just getting started,"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said. ""Nvidia affirms our view of a Mother of All Cycles thesis of the semiconductor industry, underpinned by AI and high-performance computing.""

Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating on NVDA stock and raised his price target to 1,100 from 800.

Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said Nvidia's results were a ""home run"" driven by ""jaw-dropping demand"" for its AI chips. Also, the company's guidance and commentary were at a ""drop-the-mic"" level, he said.

Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore reiterated his overweight rating on NVDA stock and hiked his price target to 630 from 500.

""These are remarkable results, particularly in the context that the company is looking at so much unmet demand,"" Moore said. ""The breadth of AI spending is clearly growing and appears to be durable. The company is executing across silicon, systems, software, and supply chain as the market is inflecting.""

"Investors in NVIDIA Corporation NVDA need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $10.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NVIDIA shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NVIDIA is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Semiconductor - General industry that ranks in the Top 16% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, 12 analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $3.69 per share to $4.48 in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about NVIDIA right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners. In addition to impressive profit potential, these trades can actually reduce your risk.

"White Brook Capital Partners, an investment management firm, released its third quarter 2023 investor letter, a copy of which can be downloaded here. White Brook Capital Partners maintains its outperformance against the S&P Midcap 400 year to date, boasting a 6.49% increase compared to the index's 4.28% gain. However, it falls short of the S&P 500's impressive gain of 12.85%. Take a moment to review the fund's top 5 holdings to gain insights into their primary investment choices for 2023.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, White Brook Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and explained its insights for the company. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara, California-based multinational technology company with a $1.1 trillion market capitalization. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) delivered a 218.64% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 191.27%. The stock closed at $465.66 per share on December 05, 2023.

Here is what White Brook Capital has to say about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it’s relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.""

"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA formally launched a China-specific lower version of its most powerful gaming chip, which complies with the U.S. restrictions on the company’s export of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to that country.

The graphic chip maker unveiled RTX 4090D on Thursday, which is available for sale on its China website. The newly launched graphic processing unit (GPU) has a reduced AI inference performance than the RTX 4090 sold in other countries.

According to a Bloomberg report, the chip has approximately 10% fewer processing cores than the RTX 4090. NVIDIA has also undertaken measures to prevent end-users from modifying the China-specific chip into a regular RTX 4090.

NVIDIA Caught in the US-China Tech War

Over the past year, President Joe Biden's administration has been imposing trade restrictions to restrict China from getting its hands on cutting-edge technologies that can strengthen its military. Last year, the U.S. government restricted NVIDIA from selling its A100, A100X and H100 integrated circuits to China and Russia. It also banned the company from exporting DGX or other systems using A100 or H100 integrated circuits.

In October 2023, the Biden administration imposed fresh restrictions on the sale of AI chips and manufacturing equipment to China. The newly expanded restrictions have blocked NVIDIA from selling two AI chips — A800 and H800 — specifically created for the Chinese market following last year’s export curb.

NVIDIA had cautioned that the restrictions may hurt its business in China. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company revealed that it may be forced to discontinue its business operations from countries on the U.S. government’s export restriction list. The rules are expected to impact NVDA’s ability to support its existing customers and complete the development of certain products in a timely manner.

Story continues

However, by launching the less powerful version of RTX 4090, which complies with all US restrictions, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company will be able to boost its sales in China. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

GenAI Investment Aids NVIDIA’s Growth

NVIDIA has witnessed a remarkable run, showcasing a staggering 243% year-to-date surge in its stock price. The company also achieved a massive milestone in May 2023 by joining the exclusive club of companies with a $1 trillion market capitalization.

NVIDIA’s robust stock price performance has been primarily driven by hopes that the company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative AI. The company dominates the market for AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.

However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.

NVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA’s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.

The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end market, NVDA expects its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $20 billion from $6.05 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Other Companies Banking on AI Investment

As organizations pivot toward digital transformation, AI investments are set to soar in the coming years, becoming pivotal to staying competitive in the digital landscape. The latest projection from the International Data Corporation forecasts a monumental surge, estimating global AI spending to surpass $300 billion by 2026, indicating a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27% from 2022 to 2026.

Tech behemoths like Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Intel Corporation INTC and UiPath Inc. PATH are seizing the immense potential of the AI sector.

Meta is amplifying its presence in the AI realm with the groundbreaking Large Language Model Meta AI, or ""Llama."" Collaborating with Microsoft, Meta introduced Llama 2, the next-gen iteration, and Code Llama, an AI model proficient in generating and discussing code using text prompts. This Zacks Rank #2 company is set to launch Meta AI in beta — a sophisticated conversational assistant slated for integration across WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, extending to their Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest 3.

Intel made a significant shift by launching AI chips for data centers and personal computers in 2023 — a strategic leap in more than four decades. This move targets a robust foothold in the expansive AI domain, spanning cloud, enterprise servers, network infrastructure and edge computing — an alignment with the ever-evolving market trends. The upcoming Intel Gaudi3 chips, slated for release in 2024, signify this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's focus on advancing AI accelerators, catering to the growing demand for generative AI models and deep learning applications.

UiPath is enhancing its platform with AI-centric services to foster top-line growth in 2024. These include augmentations to existing AutoPilot services and broader cross-platform connectivity options. This Zacks Rank #2 company's Clipboard AI, recognized as one of TIME's Best Inventions of 2023, streamlines operations by eliminating manual copy-pasting.

Samsung Electronics, a world leader in advanced semiconductor technology, and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced they have signed a multi-year agreement extension to bring multiple generations of high-performance, ultra-low-power AMD Radeon graphics solutions to an expanded portfolio of Samsung Exynos SoCs. Through the licensing extension, Samsung will bring console-level graphics quality and optimized power consumption to more mobile devices, offering an incredibly immersive and long-lasting gaming experience.

“Together with AMD, Samsung has been revolutionizing mobile graphics, including our recent collaboration that brought ray tracing capability to mobile processors for the first time in the industry,” said Seogjun Lee, Executive Vice President of Application Processor (AP) Development at Samsung Electronics. “Drawing on our technological know-how in designing ultra-low-power solutions, we will continue to drive ongoing innovation in the mobile graphics space.”

“We are excited Samsung selected multiple generations of our leadership high-performance Radeon graphics to advance the next generation of Samsung Exynos solutions,” said David Wang, Senior Vice President of the Radeon Technologies Group at AMD. “The extension of our work with Samsung is a testament to our strong technology partnership and commitment to bring the best experiences possible to mobile users.”

Samsung and AMD first announced their partnership to license AMD RDNA™ graphics architecture in 2019, leading to the co-development of Samsung Xclipse, a mobile graphics processing unit (GPU) based on the AMD RDNA 2 architecture in 2022. Xclipse was the industry’s first mobile GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing and variable rate shading features for console-like gameplay on mobile devices.","('Technology', 'Product Manufacturer', 'AMD')

"AMD wants people to remember that Nvidia’s not the only company selling AI chips. It’s announced the availability of new accelerators and processors geared toward running large language models, or LLMs.

The chipmaker unveiled the Instinct MI300X accelerator and the Instinct M1300A accelerated processing unit (APU), which the company said works to train and run LLMs. The company said the MI300X has 1.5 times more memory capacity than the previous M1250X version. Both new products have better memory capacity and are more energy-efficient than their predecessors, said AMD.

“LLMs continue to increase in size and complexity, requiring massive amounts of memory and compute,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said. “And we know the availability of GPUs is the single most important driver of AI adoption.”

Su said during a presentation that MI300X “is the highest performing accelerator in the world.” She claimed MI300X is comparable to Nvidia’s H100 chips in training LLMs but performs better on the inference side — 1.4 times better than H100 when working with Meta’s Llama 2, a 70 billion parameter LLM.

AMD partnered with Microsoft to put MI300X in its Azure virtual machines. Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott, a guest during Su’s speech, also announced the Azure ND MI300X virtual machines — first revealed in November — are now available on preview. Meta also announced it will deploy MI300 processors in its data centers.

Su said AMD released the MI300A APU for data centers, which she said are expected to grow its total addressable market to $45 billion. APUs generally combine CPUs and GPUs for faster processing. AMD said the MI300A offers higher-performance computing, faster model training, and a 30 times energy efficiency improvement. Compared to the H100, AMD said it has 1.6 times the memory capacity. It also features unified memory, so there is no need to move data from different devices anymore.

MI300A will power the El Capitan supercomputer built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. El Capitan is considered one of the most powerful supercomputers and is expected to deliver more than two exaflops of performance.

The MI300A APU “is now in production and is being built into data centers.”

Pricing information was not immediately available.

Su teased the MI300 chips during the Code Conference, saying AMD was excited about the opportunity to tap more chip users, not just from cloud providers but from enterprises and startups.

AMD also announced the latest addition to its Ryzen processors, the Ryzen 8040, which can put more native AI functions into mobile devices. The company said the 8040 series offers 1.6 times more AI processing performance than previous models and integrates neural processing units (NPUs).

The company said Ryzen 8040 would not be limited to AI processing, as it claimed video editing would be 65 percent faster and gaming would be 77 percent faster than with competing products like Intel’s chips.

AMD expects manufacturers like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Razer to release products integrating Ryzen 8040 chips in the first quarter of 2024.

Su said the next generation of its Strix Point NPUs will be released in 2024.

AMD also announced the Ryzen AI Software Platform is now widely available, which will let developers building AI models on Ryzen-powered laptops offload models into the NPU so the CPU can reduce power consumption. Users will get support for foundation models like the speech recognition model Whisper and LLMs like Llama 2.","('AMD', 'Product Manufacturer', 'AMD')

"Nearly a year ago, Nvidia kicked off this GPU generation with its GeForce RTX 4090. The 4090 offers unparalleled performance but at an unparalleled price of $1,600 (prices have not fallen). It's not for everybody, but it's a nice halo card that shows what the Ada Lovelace architecture is capable of. Fine, I guess.

The RTX 4080 soon followed, along with AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT. These cards also generally offered better performance than anything you could get from a previous-generation GPU, but at still-too-high-for-most-people prices that ranged from between $900 and $1,200 (though all of those prices have fallen by a bit). Fine, I guess.

By the time we got the 4070 Ti launch in May, we were getting down to the level of performance that had been available from previous-generation cards. These GPUs offered a decent generational jump over their predecessors (the 4070 Ti performs kind of like a 3090, and the 4070 performs kind of like a 3080). But those cards also got big price bumps that took them closer to the pricing levels of the last-gen cards they performed like. Fine, I guess.

And then we get to the true midrange cards that most people can actually afford. In this price range, AMD and Nvidia offer minor updates for around the same money as the last generation's products, in the form of the 8GB 4060 Ti, the regular 4060, and the RX 7600. It was nice to have affordable-ish midrange GPUs again after years of inflated prices and shortages, but the generation-over-generation improvements were a lot less than people had come to expect from previous refreshes. Fine, I guess!

Advertisement

(Let's also lump Intel's Arc GPUs in with this group for the sake of completeness; they're competitive, but they had buggy drivers at launch and enduring performance issues in some older games. Fine, I guess.)

And now we get to the Radeon RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT, likely the last major launches of this GPU generation. Both take an approach we've seen from these other cards; the 7800 XT offers roughly the performance of the last-gen 6800 XT at roughly the same price, and the 7700 XT delivers a nice generational performance bump while bumping the price up to roughly what you would have paid for a last-gen card with the same performance. Fine! I guess!

That's not to say either is a bad GPU. The new Radeons outperform comparable Nvidia cards while either matching or undercutting their prices. And though they're marketed primarily as 1440p GPUs, both can stretch to 4K with the right graphics settings. But the continued presence of older, often-competitive Radeon cards on the market makes it tougher to recommend them in the short term, and features like ray tracing and DLSS remain unique to Nvidia cards. The two AMD GPUs are also priced too close together, with just a $50 gap between the 7700 XT and the substantially more performant 7800 XT.","('Technology', 'Product Manufacturer', 'Nvidia')

"AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI crown in a big way with the launch of its new Instinct processor, which it claims can do the work of multiple GPUs.

CEO Lisa Su called the Instinct MI300X “the most complex thing we’ve ever built.” She held up the chip, which is about the size of a drink coaster, at an event on Tuesday in San Francisco.

Weighing in at 146 billion transistors, the MI300X comes with up to 192GB of high-bandwidth HBM3 memory shared by both the CPU and GPU. It has a total of 13 chiplets on the die. The chip also has a memory bandwidth of 5.2 TB/s, which is 60% faster than Nvidia’s H100.

The chip consists of Zen CPU cores and AMD’s next-generation CDNA 3 GPU architecture. The enormous amount of memory is the real selling point, according to Su.

“If you look at the industry today, you often see that, first of all, the model sizes are getting much larger. And you actually need multiple GPUs to run the latest large language models,” she said. “With MI300X, you can reduce the number of GPUs for this, and as model sizes continue growing, this will become even more important. So with more memory, more memory bandwidth, and fewer GPUs needed.”

AMD says the design of the MI300X makes it eight times more powerful than the existing MI250X used in Frontier (the world’s fastest supercomputer) and five times more energy efficient. It will be used in the two-plus exaFLOP El Capitan system that will be built next year at Lawrence Livermore National Labs.","('Technology', 'Product Manufacturer', 'AMD')

"Key Takeaways Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) leaped more than 9% Wednesday after the company said sales of its AI chips could top $2 billion next year.

However, revenue for the current quarter is expected to be $300 million below analysts' consensus estimates.

AMD is ramping up its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) in an effort to catch up to its bigger rival Nvidia, a leader in the global AI race.

The company's MI300 processor, which the company has described as ""the world's most advanced accelerator for generative AI,"" could help the chipmaker catch up to its bigger rival.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares leaped more than 9% Wednesday after the company said it expects to sell $2 billion in AI-powered chips next year as it attempts to catch up to market leader and rival Nvidia (NVDA).

The company, which reported better-than-expected third quarter earnings yesterday, is projecting revenue of $6.1 billion (plus or minus $300 million) in the last three months of the year. That number is up from $5.8 billion for the third quarter but below the $6.4 billion analysts had expected.

However, according to some analysts, AMD's lineup of AI processors is more important than its embedded business—chips for industrial, automotive and networking sectors.

According to Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson, the annual market for AMD's embedded business is less than $10 billion while rival Nvidia on its own is likely to exceed that number in quarterly GPU sales. So, the opportunity is big for AMD.

""In our view, meaningfully better growth expectations for AMD's AI products trump questions around where/when (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) FPGA sales will bottom and what is normalized revenue for AMD's embedded business,"" Bryson wrote in a note Wednesday. Field Programmable Gate Arrays are a type of circuit.

AMD Ramps Up AI Investments

AMD is ramping up its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) in an effort to catch up to rival Nvidia, which has become one of the world's biggest semiconductor companies with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion.

AMD's MI300 processor, which the company has described as ""the world's most advanced accelerator for generative AI,"" could help the chipmaker catch up to its bigger rival. Sales of AI-powered graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to reach $2 billion next year, AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su said on the company's earnings call.

Su earlier this year called AI ""the defining technology shaping the next generation of computing and the largest strategic growth opportunity for AMD,"" and said the company is ""laser-focused on accelerating the deployment of AI platforms at scale in the data center.""

Shipments of MI300 processors are expected to begin by the end of 2023, Su said at a product showcase in June.

With Wednesday's gain, shares of AMD are up almost 69% so far this year. While impressive, it's a small gain compared to those of rival Nvidia, which has almost tripled year-to-date and is the S&P 500's best-performing stock this year.","('Technology', 'Market Leader', 'Nvidia (NVDA')

"Yesterday we reported that MSI announced a wave of firmware updates designed to address and alleviate potential issues with users on AM5 using AMD's Ryzen 7000X3D processors with 3D V-Cache. One of the main changes with MSI's latest UEFI firmware for AM5 included voltage restrictions when using Ryzen 7000X3D series CPUs. Further to recent reports of users with AMD Ryzen 7000X3D processors experiencing damage to their chip and motherboard socket, we reached out to AMD this morning to seek clarification. AMD has just responded with an official statement concerning the current problem.

The statement directly from AMD is as follows:

""We are aware of a limited number of reports online claiming that excess voltage while overclocking may have damaged the motherboard socket and pin pads. We are actively investigating the situation and are working with our ODM partners to ensure voltages applied to Ryzen 7000X3D CPUs via motherboard BIOS settings are within product specifications. Anyone whose CPU may have been impacted by this issue should contact AMD customer support.""

As the statement clarifies, AMD themselves are investigating the issue that users have been experiencing, which has been reported on through various channels such as social media and Reddit. This is further to MSI, which launched new firmware yesterday, and ASUS announced new firmware today for users with AMD Ryzen 7000X3D processors, such as the Ryzen 9 7950X3D and the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The new firmware specifically limits the SoC voltages applied so that these critical limits aren't breached when users enable AMD EXPO memory profiles on supported DRAM.

While AMD hasn't officially confirmed the problem regarding the burnt pads on the Ryzen 7000X3D series processors and the burnt pins within the motherboard socket, AMD is actively looking to resolve this issue. One theory thus far is that the issue is being triggered when users are enabling AMD EXPO memory profiles – which, much like Intel's XMP counterpart, is technically a form of overclocking and officially voids the product warranty. Given the rollout of new firmware, which targets SoC voltages and restricts them, all things point towards voltages and overclocking said processors, which are, by default, multiplier and CPU VCore locked.

AMD is actively working with motherboard vendors such as MSI, ASUS, GIGABYTE, and ASRock to roll out the new firmware. AMD also specifies that if users have a Ryzen 7000X3D processor affected by this problem, to contact AMD customer support directly.

Update (04/27): AMD has officially made a second statement regarding the Ryzen 7000 and 7000X3D burnout issues. It is as follows:

We have root caused the issue and have already distributed a new AGESA that puts measures in place on certain power rails on AM5 motherboards to prevent the CPU from operating beyond its specification limits, including a cap on SOC voltage at 1.3V. None of these changes affect the ability of our Ryzen 7000 Series processors to overclock memory using EXPO or XMP kits or boost performance using PBO technology. We expect all of our ODM partners to release new BIOS for their AM5 boards over the next few days. We recommend all users to check their motherboard manufacturers website and update their BIOS to ensure their system has the most up to date software for their processor. Anyone whose CPU may have been impacted by this issue should contact AMD customer support. Our customer service team is aware of the situation and prioritizing these cases.

"We haven't even gotten close to peak AI anything, but you won't be able to buy a new laptop next year without seeing it everywhere, notable in its absence as well as its presence. That's because the business interests of everybody who wants to sell you hardware or software are in complete alignment, which will result in a gravitational pull we can't escape. AMD on Wednesday jumped in that line with its new Ryzen 8040 series of mobile processors at its Advancing AI event.

On-chip AI acceleration is critical for mobile devices, because it ameliorates the battery-killing nature of continual AI processing, which is far more cost-effective and environmentally better to perform locally than in the cloud -- data centers to support consumer AI use are a black hole of energy usage and expensive to run. The accelerators are dedicated to iterating through and managing memory for the results of the vector calculations of small, pretrained models running on the device.

All the primary computer manufacturers now include a neural processing unit tile on its flagship processor's die. AMD added it with its Ryzen 7040 series, Qualcomm rolled out its Snapdragon Elite in October, Intel announced it as part of the new Meteor Lake architecture (its first chips with the accelerator are rumored to debut next week) and Apple made its Neural Engine a central part of its M series architecture from the start.

In parallel with its GPU capabilities, branded RDNA, AMD refers to its NPU's capabilities XDNA. The Ryzen 7040 series (Phoenix) included the first generation of the NPU. The mobile processors AMD announced Wednesday for its Ryzen 8040 series (Hawk Point) uses the same NPU architecture but offers better performance. AMD rates Phoenix at 10 trillion operations per second (by the NPU alone), while it says Hawk Point delivers 16 TOPS.

Max boost (GHz) Cores Threads NPU Power class Integrated graphics Ryzen 9 8945HS 5.2 8 16 Yes 35-54W Radeon 780M Ryzen 7 8845HS 5.1 8 16 Yes 35-54W Radeon 780M Ryzen 7 8840HS 5.1 8 16 Yes 20-30W Radeon 780M Ryzen 7 8840U 5.1 8 16 Yes 15-30W Radeon 780M Ryzen 5 8645HS 5 6 12 Yes 35-54W Radeon 760M Ryzen 5 8640HS 4.9 6 12 Yes 20-30W Radeon 760M Ryzen 5 8640U 4.9 6 12 Yes 15-30W Radeon 760M Ryzen 5 8540U 4.9 6 12 No 15-30W Radeon 740M Ryzen 3 8440U 4.7 4 8 No 15-30W Radeon 740M

Laptops with the first series of Hawk Point chips are expected to be available by the end of March, and the company has its subsequent-gen XDNA 2 slated to ship to laptop manufacturers later in 2024. AMD claims those ""Strix Point"" Ryzen processors will offer three times better performance for generative AI over Hawk Point. And that may complicate your buy-now-or-wait decision.

Because CPU branding is complicated, don't assume that all 8040-series CPUs have the NPU. At the bottom of the stack, the two cheapest processors don't have it, which means the NPU may be out of the reach of budget buyers.

The Acer Nitro V 16, announced Wednesday. Acer

One of the spotlight products announced, the updated 16-inch Acer Nitro V 16 gaming laptop goes ""up to"" a Ryzen 7 8845HS and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, but a mystery base configuration starts at $1,000. Who knows if that base includes an NPU-equipped CPU or how price scales for the configurations. Acers equipped with the NPU will use it for optimizing battery life and expanded power-management features. The Nitro's expected to ship in March, in line with the wait we usually have from announcement to shipping of new chips this time of year.

Another reason for the aligned push is to motivate software developers to use the application programming interfaces in order to offload much of the inferencing and generative work the way they address the graphics accelerator for a smoother experience with interactive graphics tasks.

There are a lot of developers who already use custom AI models, like Adobe, Zoom, OBS (in OBS Studio, for streamers) and Microsoft. But there's a multitude of APIs for handling the on-device model and interaction with the operating system -- WindowsML, Intel OpenVINO, Nvidia's integration into its own software (like DLSS in the graphics driver and Broadcast) and more. It's still all shaking out.","('Technology', 'Product Manufacturer', 'AMD')

"AMD’s RDNA 3 graphics architecture has proven its ability to deliver significant performance improvements and better energy efficiency over its RDNA 2 graphics cards. This has been a boon for gaming, but one could argue this will be even better for workstation cards. We got an idea of what a high-performance RDNA 3 workstation card can do with the AMD Radeon Pro W7800 ($599). Now, with the Radeon Pro W7600, we get to see what a balanced solution can do, and it does quite well in its own way with low power draw and a compact build.

Design: Radeon RX 7600 Goes to Work

Anyone who has kept up with the most recent graphics card releases will find the Radeon Pro W7600 to be familiar. That’s because the card is similar to the AMD Radeon RX 7600 in many ways. Both cards feature the same GPU core, with the exact same amount of resources available and even the same memory interface. You'll find only a handful of details that differ between the two cards.

Workstation cards are often packed in with as many other cards as possible into a chassis to gain extra performance, which makes the size and cooling scheme of cards matter more than with consumer-grade graphics cards, which nowadays are mostly installed solo. This led AMD to design the W7600 as a more complacent single-slot card that would enable you to wedge far more cards in together than with dual-slot cards. Naturally, this comes with some trade-offs, including a smaller cooler and a slightly lower clock speed.

Other than that, the biggest changes between the W7600 and the RX 7600 lie in the BIOS, which is optimized for workstation tasks on the W7600. You'll also notice the price difference that sets the W7600 at $599, which is more than double the Radeon RX 7600’s base price of $269. Professional-grade products are priced differently for businesses and generally are sold in bulk purchases.

The ports on the card were also changed up slightly versus the Radeon RX 7600, with no HDMI port and four DisplayPort 2.1 connections. The power connections can vary somewhat on Radeon RX 7600 cards, but most of those also ship with a single 8-pin PCIe power connection, whereas the Radeon Pro W7600 instead relies on a single 6-pin PCIe power connection instead.

Test Setup and Spec Comparison

The AMD Radeon Pro W7600 was tested using our 2022 GPU test bed with an Intel Core i9-12900K processor and an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard. The processor was operated at stock clock speeds with a Corsair Hydro Series H100X water cooler and 32GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM clocked at 5,600MHz.

To ensure the system has plenty of power for all tests, I equipped the test bed with a Corsair HX1500i power supply that can handle up to 1,500 watts of power. All tests were performed inside of Windows 11 Pro with all of the latest updates installed.

Before diving into the test results, it’s important to note that the Radeon Pro W7600 and the similar Radeon Pro W7500 are markedly different products from the other cards we were able to test. These AMD GPUs are far less expensive, far more compact, and of course have far fewer resources. This resulted in them being outperformed in most tests. But, on the rare occasions they pushed ahead slightly, we can be sure it was due entirely to the advantages inherent in these being workstation cards.

Synthetic Tests

3DMark’s Port Royal is a useful test for graphics cards that takes full advantage of ray-tracing hardware on GPUs. Adobe’s Premiere Pro and Luxmark are both focused on testing content creation and GPGPU performance.

Though the Radeon Pro W7600 performed poorly in these tests compared with the other cards, it's not a bad showing if you consider the price-for-performance ratio. The Radeon Pro W7800 costs $2,499, and this makes the $599 W7600 hitting about a third or more of its performance numbers seem like a moderate bargain. However, for these particular tests, you’d be better off with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which was faster than both while costing just $999.

SPECworkstation 3.1

Tests that are more oriented towards workstation cards, like those included in the SPECworkstation 3.1 test suite, give us a better idea of the Radeon Pro W7600’s potential.

In all of these tests, the Radeon Pro W7600 continued to perform at least about a third as fast as the Radeon Pro W7800, and in many tests it fared far better than that. This may not sound like a win for the Radeon Pro W7600, but it’s worth remembering that these cards are intended to be used in tandem with other workstation cards. You could buy four Radeon Pro W7600 cards for slightly less than what a single Radeon Pro W7800 costs, and those cards working together might net you better results than what that sole W7800 card can muster.

That said, we can’t speak to exactly how it would perform, as scaling across multiple cards is never quite so straightforward. Nevertheless, it’s possible that would result in better performance overall than the Radeon Pro W7800. This also holds up in comparison with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, which is already behind the Radeon Pro W7600 in select test sets like medical-02, snx-03 (Siemens CAD), and sw-04 (Solidworks). In many of the tests that show the RTX 4090 ahead, adding a second Radeon Pro W7600 would tend to even things up or hand the win to the Radeon Pro W7600 cards.

AIDA64 GPGPU Tests

AIDA64 proves highly useful for testing workstation cards and graphics cards alike. It tests a number of different metrics but doesn’t tend to favor the workstation cards.

The memory bandwidth portion of the AIDA64 gives us insight into the bandwidth between the RAM and the GPU on a graphics card, which is always vitally important to performance. The Radeon Pro W7600 has just a 128-bit memory interface, which left it at a disadvantage here. This is in part what caused it to lag behind the other cards in this test, with its significantly fewer resources being the other part of what held it back.

Though these results look bleak, it’s again worth considering the significant difference in price, as it performed better than you would expect for a card that costs far less than the competition.

Game Tests

Workstation cards are not intended for gaming, but games serve far too well at pushing cards to their limits and gauging their performance for us to not utilize them here for testing as an ""interesting aside.""

Though you can get similar results with an RX 7600 for less, the Radeon Pro W7600 ran the games we tested well even at higher resolutions. Running games at 4K was a bit of a struggle, but this was helped by FSR that boosted frame rates back to playable levels.

Power Consumption

Using a Kill-A-Watt power meter, I measured the power draw of the GPU test bed as a whole in order to determine the rough power consumption of each of the tested cards while running the AIDA64 GPGPU test. Only the graphics card in question was changed between tests, which gives us a relative idea of the power consumption of each card.

This is one area in which the Radeon Pro W7600 came out well ahead of its competition. When it came to performance, the Radeon Pro W7600 may have achieved only a third of the W7800’s output, but it also consumed far less power. This makes the card all the more alluring for use inside of compact systems and especially those that have strict power and heat limitations.

Verdict: A Slim Sleeper Workstation Card

AMD's Radeon Pro W7600 managed to perform relatively well throughout our tests. It never beat out the competition, but as most of the competing cards cost significantly more, are far larger, and draw far more power, that’s to be expected. Instead, the card performs reasonably well for its place in the market, driving a hefty amount of compute performance at a far more palatable price of $599 and with a much more compact form factor and lower power draw.

These characteristics help it stand out for those that need some amount of compute performance for workstation applications but don’t need or can’t afford the likes of an AMD Radeon Pro W7800. That said, if you don't need to run workstation applications, the shine comes off; you'd be better off considering consumer cards that will work well enough for less.
