We are committed to an ads-supported digital business model, because it is the cornerstone of an inclusive internet where everyone can access online services and content for free. It allows people to use services like Facebook and Instagram for free while benefiting from seeing personalised advertising, helping them discover new products and brands that are most relevant to them.

Personalised advertising also enables businesses of all sizes – particularly small and medium-sized businesses – to find customers most likely to be interested in what they offer. This creates considerable value for businesses: in Europe, every Euro spent on our ads drives on average 3.37 Euros in revenues for advertisers, supporting over €84 billion in business revenues every year.¹

However, Europe’s regulatory landscape is evolving. And with new regulatory interpretations of permitted legal bases for personalised advertising under the GDPR, as well as the coming into force of the Digital Markets Act, we are now required to offer people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland an alternative way of using Facebook and Instagram.

That’s why, in October, we announced that people in the EU could choose to continue to use Facebook and Instagram with ads, or they could choose to pay a monthly fee for a subscription service with no ads on Facebook and Instagram.² If a person chooses to subscribe, they won’t see ads and we will not process their information for personalised advertising.

We introduced this choice, called ‘Subscription for no ads’, as our consent solution to comply with a unique combination of connected and sometimes overlapping EU regulatory obligations with differing compliance deadlines.

Subscriptions as an alternative to seeing advertising are a well-established and economically viable business model spanning many industries, from news publishing and gaming to music and entertainment. That’s why we believe it is the best compliance solution. Like countless other businesses, we believe it allows us to meet changing regulatory obligations while offering users a clear choice.

‘Subscription for no ads’ addresses the latest regulatory developments, guidance and judgments shared by leading European regulators and the courts over recent years. Specifically, it conforms to direction given by the highest court in Europe: in July, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) endorsed the subscriptions model as a way for people to consent to data processing for personalised advertising. And even before that decision, the validity of a subscription service as part of a model to obtain valid consent had been acknowledged by numerous European data protection authorities, including in France, Denmark and Germany.

Regardless of whether a person chooses to subscribe or not, everyone who uses Facebook and Instagram can continue to use our Privacy Centre to access the extensive range of tools that we have built to give people choice over the information they share and how we process their data. Those who choose to continue to see personalised ads will also continue to have full control over whether or not we use information from third party websites and apps to personalise the ads we show them. And as has been the case for people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland since 2018, unless a person actively opts in to see ads based on information from third parties, it won’t happen.

Additionally, those who choose to continue to see personalised ads can also access features to further manage how their data is used to inform their ads, including Why am I seeing this ad? and our long-standing ad preferences tools. We remain committed to ensuring that people who choose to use our services for free continue to have a positive ad experience.

At Meta, we believe that technology is about giving everyone a voice, and that the best way to do that is to offer services for free – and that’s why we will always advocate for an internet funded by ads.

2. EU, EEA and Switzerland.

Originally published on October 30, 2023 at 5:00 AM PT:

To comply with evolving European regulations, we are introducing a new subscription option in the EU, EEA and Switzerland. In November, we will be offering people who use Facebook or Instagram and reside in these regions the choice to continue using these personalised services for free with ads, or subscribe to stop seeing ads. While people are subscribed, their information will not be used for ads.

People in these countries will be able to subscribe for a fee to use our products without ads. Depending on where you purchase it will cost €9.99/month on the web or €12.99/month on iOS and Android. Regardless of where you purchase, the subscription will apply to all linked Facebook and Instagram accounts in a user’s Accounts Center. As is the case for many online subscriptions, the iOS and Android pricing take into account the fees that Apple and Google charge through respective purchasing policies. Until March 1, 2024, the initial subscription covers all linked accounts in a user’s Accounts Center. However, beginning March 1, 2024, an additional fee of €6/month on the web and €8/month on iOS and Android will apply for each additional account listed in a user’s Account Center.

Why Are We Doing This?

We believe in an ad-supported internet, which gives people access to personalised products and services regardless of their economic status. It also allows small businesses to reach potential customers, grow their business and create new markets, driving growth in the European economy. And like other companies we’ll continue to advocate for an ad-supported internet, even with our new subscription offering in the EU, EEA and Switzerland. But we respect the spirit and purpose of these evolving European regulations, and are committed to complying with them.

We announced in August our intention to move people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland to the GDPR legal basis of “Consent” for the purpose of processing data collected on our own platforms for advertising purposes. We made that change to address a number of evolving and emerging regulatory requirements in the region. This includes how our lead data protection regulator in the EU, the Irish Data Protection Commission, is interpreting GDPR following a recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and anticipating the entry into force of the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

The option for people to purchase a subscription for no ads balances the requirements of European regulators while giving users choice and allowing Meta to continue serving all people in the EU, EEA and Switzerland. In its ruling, the CJEU expressly recognised that a subscription model, like the one we are announcing, is a valid form of consent for an ads funded service.

If you choose to continue to use our products for free, your experience will stay the same – and that experience will continue to be supported by the tools and settings that we have created to empower people to control their ads experience. These include Ad Preferences, which offers a range of controls that enable you to influence the ads you see as well as the data used to inform these ads, including activity information from ad partners. We also have tools in our product that explain “Why am I seeing this ad?”, as well as how people can manage their ad experience.

Meanwhile, advertisers will be able to continue running personalised advertising campaigns in Europe to reach those who choose to continue to receive a free, ad-supported online service. Going forward, we will continue to invest to build new tools that preserve the value that both people and businesses get out of personalised advertising, while allowing users to control their ads experience on our platforms. The subscription for no ads will be available for people aged 18 and up, and we’re continuing to explore how to provide teens with a useful and responsible ad experience given this evolving regulatory landscape.

This new subscription model has been factored into our most recently announced business outlook and guidance. This post contains forward-looking statements, including about Meta’s business outlook and the evolving regulatory landscape. You should not rely on these statements as predictions of future events.

"Meta plans to release its first pair of smart glasses with a display in 2025 alongside a neural interface smartwatch designed to control them, The Verge has learned. Meanwhile, its first pair of full-fledged AR glasses, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has predicted will eventually be as widely used as mobile phones, is planned for 2027.

The details were shared with thousands of employees in Meta’s Reality Labs division on Tuesday during a roadmap presentation of its AR and VR efforts that was shared with The Verge. Altogether, they show how Meta is planning to keep investing in consumer hardware after a series of setbacks and broader cost cutting across the company. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment for this story.

With regards to the VR roadmap, employees were told that Meta’s flagship Quest 3 headset coming later this year will be two times thinner, at least twice as powerful, and cost slightly more than the $400 Quest 2. Like the recently announced Quest Pro, it will prominently feature mixed reality experiences that don’t fully immerse the wearer, thanks to front-facing cameras that pass through video of the real world. Meta has sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets to date, Mark Rabkin, the company’s vice president for VR, told employees during the presentation.

Meta’s main challenge with the Quest 3, which is internally codenamed Stinson, will be convincing people to pay “a bit more” money than the cost of the existing Quest 2, according to Rabkin. “We have to get enthusiasts fired up about it,” he told employees Tuesday. “We have to prove to people that all this power, all these new features are worth it.”

Meta has sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets to date

Mixed reality will be a huge selling point, and Rabkin said there will be a new “smart guardian” to help wearers navigate the real world while they are wearing the device. “The main north star for the team was from the moment you put on this headset, the mixed reality has to make it feel better, easier, more natural,” he said. “You can walk effortlessly through your house knowing you can see perfectly well. You can put anchors and things on your desktop. You can take your coffee. You can stay in there much longer.”

There will be 41 new apps and games shipping for the Quest 3, including new mixed reality experiences to take advantage of the updated hardware, Rabkin said. In 2024, he said that Meta plans to ship a more “accessible” headset codenamed Ventura. “The goal for this headset is very simple: pack the biggest punch we can at the most attractive price point in the VR consumer market.”

Rabkin didn’t say whether a second generation of the recent Meta Quest Pro, which received poor reviews from The Verge and others, is coming anytime soon. The closest to what sounds like a successor will be “way out in the future” after Ventura in 2024, when Meta is planning its most advanced headset codenamed La Jolla featuring photorealistic, codec avatars.

“We want to make it higher resolution for work use and really nail work, text and things like that,” Rabkin said about La Jolla. “We want to take a lot of the comfort things from Quest Pro and how it sits on your head and the split architecture and bring that in for comfort.”

Meanwhile, he acknowledged that the current Quest is struggling to keep new users engaged. “Right now, we’re on our third year of Quest 2,” he told employees. “And sadly, the newer cohorts that are coming in, the people who bought it this last Christmas, they’re just not as into it” or engaged as “the ones who bought it early.”

Rabkin pushed employees to make the sharing of VR content on other platforms “trivial,” redesign the Quest store to make it more “dynamic,” and give developers the ability to do things like automated promotions.

The current Quest is struggling to keep new users engaged

“We need to be better at growth and retention and resurrection,” he said. “We need to be better at social and actually make those things more reliable, more intuitive so people can count on it.”

Even with these struggles, Meta has built an early lead in virtual reality hardware. But its big swings over the coming years speak to the serious competition that’s about to arrive. Apple is expected to announce a high-end virtual reality headset sometime this year, while Sony just released the well-received PSVR 2 for console gamers. Meanwhile, Apple, Google, Snap, and others are all racing toward something even bigger: augmented reality glasses — and that’s where Meta is hoping its early efforts in the mixed reality space will really pay off.

AR glasses and neural interfaces

Aside from the Quest lineup, Meta also has thousands of employees building future AR glasses and wrist devices for controlling them. The key difference from VR is that the company intends for AR glasses to eventually be worn throughout the day as a replacement for smartphones. Zuckerberg has called them the “holy grail” device that will “redefine our relationship with technology” by the end of this decade.

During Tuesday’s roadmap presentation, Alex Himel, the company’s vice president for AR, laid out the plan for a bevy of devices through 2027. The first launch will come this fall with the second generation of Meta’s camera-equipped smart glasses it released in 2021 with Luxottica, the parent company of Ray-Ban.

In 2025, Himel said the third generation of the smart glasses will ship with a display that he called a “viewfinder” for viewing incoming text messages, scanning QR codes, and translating text from another language in real time. The glasses will come with a “neural interface” band that allows the wearer to control the glasses through hand movements, such as swiping fingers on an imaginary D-pad. Eventually, he said the band will let the wearer use a virtual keyboard and type at the same words per minute as what mobile phones allow.

The smartwatch will integrate with Meta’s social media apps and offer health and fitness features

While Meta canned its plans for a smartwatch with a detachable display and cameras, it’s still working on another smartwatch to accompany its 2025 glasses, Himel confirmed.

“We don’t want people to have to choose between an input device on their wrist and smartwatch functionality that they’ve come to love,” he said. “So we are building a neural interfaces watch. Number one, this device will do input: input to control your glasses, input to control the functionality on your wrist, and input to control the world around you.”

Himel showed employees a demo of the glasses in which, during a video call, the cameras on the glasses were showing the wearer’s front-facing perspective at the same time as a selfie view was being shown from the camera on the watch. He said the smartwatch will be an optional upgrade from a pared-down neural band that comes with the glasses, and that it will also integrate with Meta’s social media apps like WhatsApp and offer health and fitness features.

Meta’s first true pair of AR glasses, which the company has been internally developing for 8 years under the codename Orion, are more technically advanced, expensive, are designed to project high-quality holograms of avatars onto the real world. There will be an “internal launch” for employees to test the glasses in 2024, according to Himel. A version won’t be released to the public until 2027, when Meta will launch what Himel called its “Innovation” line of AR glasses for early adopters alongside a “Scale” line of the less advanced smart glasses and the second generation of its neural smartwatch.

Himel framed the market opportunity around the almost two billion pairs of regular glasses and hundreds of millions of smartwatches that are sold each year. “If we can put on shelves a great product at a great price with the right value, we believe we can get into these upgrade cycles and have a lot of growth of our devices,” he told the room. “It’s on us to deliver.”

“A business unlike anything we’ve seen on mobile phones before”

Meta is planning to rely on its existing business model of advertising to help it make money off these future devices. Himel said the company thinks it can make a higher average revenue per user than what it makes currently in social media, thanks to a combination of selling virtual goods, optional add-ons like cloud backups, and AR ads.

“We should be able to run a very good ads business,” he said. “I think it’s easy to imagine how ads would show up in space when you have AR glasses on. Our ability to track conversions, which is where there has been a lot of focus as a company, should also be close to 100 percent.”

“If we’re hitting anything near projections, it will be a tremendous business,” he said. “A business unlike anything we’ve seen on mobile phones before.”","(meta, product manufacturer, smart glasses)

"Meta on Monday was fined a record 1.2 billion euros ($1.3 billion) and ordered to stop transferring data collected from Facebook users in Europe to the United States, in a major ruling against the social media company for violating European Union data protection rules.

The penalty, announced by Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, is potentially one of the most consequential in the five years since the European Union enacted the landmark data privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation. Regulators said the company failed to comply with a 2020 decision by the European Union’s highest court that Facebook data shipped across the Atlantic was not sufficiently protected from American spy agencies.

But it remains unclear if or when Meta will ever need to cordon off the data of Facebook users in Europe. Meta said it would appeal the decision, setting up a potentially lengthy legal process.

At the same time, European Union and American officials are negotiating a new data-sharing pact that would provide legal protections for Meta and scores of other companies to continue moving information between the United States and Europe — a pact that could nullify much of the European Union’s ruling on Monday. A preliminary deal was announced last year.","(meta, regulatory body, european union)

Meta is the company formerly known as Facebook that Mark Zuckerberg first worked on while at Harvard, later dropping out to build the business. The story was popularized in the 2010 film ""The Social Network.""

Today Zuckerberg essentially owns Facebook and the rest of Meta with his majority stake, giving him primary control of the company and its divisions. Meta is publicly traded, so a single person or company does not technically own it.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

In early 2023, Meta earnings become more favorable after six straight quarters of losses. The company beat earnings estimates for Q1 and Q2 2023. Meta earnings are released quarterly.

In March, Meta announced it laid off 10,000 workers in a second wave of 2023 job cuts. Zuckerberg said the company would also close around 5,000 of the job openings it had yet to fill.

In an analysis of tech companies conducting mass layoffs since 2022, Insider found that after Twitter, Meta layoffs were the most drastic. The company trimmed its workforce by 24%.

Next to Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg is likely the most well-known current or former Meta employee. Sandberg stepped down from her position as Meta's chief operating officer in June 2022. During her tenure, she pioneered her own brand of feminism and weathered high-profile scandals.

Mark Zuckerberg

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg grew up outside New York City and dropped out of Harvard after founding Facebook. He's built it into a multibillion-dollar company while weathering numerous scandals and controversies.

Zuckerberg's net worth is estimated to be around $108 billion. His fortunes are largely tied to Meta stock, and his wealth has risen and fallen alongside it.

Priscilla Chan met Zuckerberg at Harvard University and married in 2012. Zuckerberg's wife spends most of her time on the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which is the couple's philathropy project.

The Zuckerberg family includes three kids, Maxima, 7; August, 5; and baby Aurelia, born in March 2023. There's a recurring theme that ties their three daughters' names together: all are linked to the names of Roman emperors, a part of history that fascinates Zuckerberg.

Instagram and Whatsapp

Meta started simply as ""The Facebook,"" but the company has since grown into more. Besides Facebook, Meta apps include WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and the Horizon Metaverse.

WhatsApp might be a little-known messaging app in the US, but in many parts of the globe, it's an essential part of everyday life. The Facebook-owned app is easily one of the most popular messaging services in the world.

Most people are familiar with using WhatsApp via a mobile app on their phone, but not everyone is aware that it's also possible to use WhatsApp Web on a computer desktop, too.

Built almost entirely around sharing images and videos, Instagram is a cultural powerhouse today with over a billion registered accounts. Small businesses, large institutions, news organizations, celebrities, photographers, musicians, and a cottage industry of influencers all use Instagram to communicate with a visual twist.

The whole Meta ecosystem is tied together through various programs, including Meta Pay, which can be used when purchasing items, sending money, or donating to charitable causes on Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

Facebook

About 3 billion users log into Facebook monthly. Facebook presences primarily consist of personal profiles or entity pages. You need a Facebook profile to create a Facebook page, but unlike profiles, which must be about a real person, a Facebook page can be about anything, from the ramen shop you manage to the band you promote.

Advertisement

While many users take advantage of the mobile app, the Facebook desktop platform still allows users to post as well.

Facebook Lite is also an app that's smaller in size than the regular Facebook app, which can be useful for people without access to a strong internet connection. Meta markets Facebook Lite as being compatible with speeds as low as 2G.

Features

Facebook offers many features for customizing your online presence, connecting with friends, watching video content, and even building a business.

You can easily personalize your profile to make it feel unique to you. A great place to start is changing your Facebook cover photo.

Advertisement

You can also change your name on Facebook in the Settings section of the website or mobile app, which is useful if you've gotten married, adopted a new nickname, or made an error when you first set up your account.

Facebook Messenger, now simply Messenger, is a popular messaging app that you can use to stay in touch with many of your friends, family, and coworkers. The advantage of Messenger is you only need to know someone's name or Facebook display name to contact them — no need to acquire an email address, phone number, or any other contact details.

Facebook also offers its own dating service, baked into the Facebook mobile app. While it has a relatively modest user base, Facebook Dating is an attractive alternative because it leverages the existing Facebook audience and promises to more easily connect you with people who share your interests and activities. In addition, unlike almost any other dating app, it's free, with no premium features behind a paywall.

Facebook Live allows you to watch or stream your own real-time or recorded videos. These streams can originate from friends or professional broadcast organizations, and both user groups can also post regular, pre-recorded video content to their timelines and stories.

Advertisement

If you want to save videos you watch on Facebook to your phone or computer, there are ways to make Facebook video downloads via a mobile app or browser-based workaround on your computer.

Business owners will find that Facebook business pages are free to both create and use. They can be a powerful tool to help you reach a new audience, gain popularity, and grow your brand.

If you have multiple businesses or social media pages to manage, Meta Business Suite allows you to bulk upload content, plan content publication well beforehand, and coordinate marketing campaigns with partners.

If you find yourself ready to delete a Facebook page — whether because the business closed, the band broke up, or you simply don't want a given page to be out there anymore — it's easy to delete Facebook pages via the main site and the Facebook app.

Meta Portal, formerly called Facebook Portal, is an Alexa-enabled smart device used to video chat with friends and family. The Portal is like a dedicated video phone with a futuristic flare. The Portal has been discontinued, but the devices can still be purchased.

Security & Privacy

While Facebook is convenient for connecting with people, it also holds more personal data than you may realize. If you don't have the right Facebook profile privacy settings, a lot of that personal data might be on public display.

For security, it's also important to log out of Facebook occasionally, which you can do on one or all devices. It's a good habit to sign out of active sessions on all social media platforms to keep your accounts safe.

It's also important to occasionally change your Facebook password. Doing so will safeguard against bad actors trying to access your account.

Advertisement

Facebook also lets you block or unblock anyone quickly without alerting them. Unblocking someone on Facebook will even re-add them to your Friends list if you were friends before the block.

Like most platforms, you'll sometimes find Facebook down unexpectedly. If the site or app isn't working, try refreshing your browser, clearing your cache, or reopen the app.

Sick of the whole social platform? You can deactivate or delete Facebook accounts to temporarily or permanently discontinue your presence on the site.

And if you still have questions or an issue you can't troubleshoot, you can always contact Facebook customer support.

Facebook Marketplace

Selling your stuff online has become a popular alternative to garage sales. For casual sellers, Facebook Marketplace is a free option that connects you with potential buyers in your area.

You can get Facebook Marketplace on app or desktop platforms by clicking the Marketplace icon.

Unfortunately, Marketplace's popularity also makes it an attractive destination for scams. Thankfully, if you know what to look for, scammers aren't hard to detect. Arm yourself with knowledge about the most common signs of Facebook Marketplace scams so you can buy and sell safely.

Metaverse

When Facebook changed its name to Meta in late 2021, it went all-in on its concept of a Metaverse. For most people, accessing Facebook's Metaverse, which is called Horizon, is as simple as buying a Meta Quest 2 VR headset.

Oculus and Meta Quest

Palmer Luckey was 20 years old when he founded the virtual reality company Oculus VR in 2012. And two years later, he sold it to Meta for $2 billion in cash and stock.

Luckey began designing and building VR headsets in 2009 and completed the first prototype for what would become the first Oculus headset the following year in his parents' garage in Long Beach, California, when he was 17 years old.

Luckey's first Oculus Rift virtual reality headset was released in 2013, and it was a watershed moment for technology fans everywhere. The then-cutting-edge Oculus Rift DK1 was not the first VR headset ever created, but it was the first high-quality yet affordable VR system available to the general public.

John Carmack served as consulting chief technology officer for Meta's virtual reality initiatives since 2019 when he transitioned from a full-time into a ""consulting"" role. He initially joined VR headset creator Oculus in 2013, and the company was acquired by Facebook, now known as Meta, in 2014. Meta later changed the name of the VR headset brand to Meta Quest.

Meta VR products currently include two headsets, the Quest 2 and the Quest Pro. In June, the company announced it will release the Quest 3.

The Meta Quest Pro is Meta's latest VR headset and has features aimed at professional customers rather than gamers and hobbyists. The Quest Pro has augmented reality capabilities integrating virtual elements into the real world. That makes this a so-called mixed-reality headset.

Previously, the VR maker had also sold the Oculus Go, which is now discontinued.

The Meta VR headset comes with a pair of Quest 2 controllers that you can use to interact with the virtual environment and play most games.

Advertisement

To get started, you need to download Meta content, like games and apps to your headset. You have the option to play by casting Meta content to a PC, mobile phone, or TV to make your virtual reality screen a group experience. You can cast directly from the headset using the Camera in the app library or cast from the mobile app by tapping the Cast button at the top of the Meta Quest app in the Facebook website or app.

Oculus Link is a feature built into Quest 2, the Meta VR headset that allows you to connect your Quest to a PC. While the Meta Quest 2 is a completely self-contained wireless VR headset that can run games and apps from the large Quest library, Link adds an additional dimension, letting you use your computer's substantially higher processing power to run more complex PC VR games.

That's good news because there's an enormous library of games on Steam, originally developed for other VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. They run perfectly on the Quest 2, giving gamers many options for additional Meta Quest games.

It's important to know how to factory reset the Oculus 2, Quest, or any other headset if you plan to resell it to wipe all of your data.

Oculus headsets can allow up to four accounts to have an Oculus headset on at any time. While secondary accounts can still purchase games and use apps, they cannot connect their Oculus account to the Oculus mobile app.

Starting last year, it became possible once again to use an Oculus headset without needing to have a Facebook or Instagram account.","(technology, product manufacturer, meta)

"Update on December 14, 2023 at 3:05AM PT:

Today, Mark Zuckerberg announced that we are expanding Threads to countries across Europe. We’re excited to give more people the opportunity to follow and join the conversations they care about. Since launching Threads in July, we’ve made significant improvements to the app, including a web experience, a Following Feed, the ability to edit a post, search with keywords, tag topics and more.

People in the EU can choose to create a Threads profile that is connected to their Instagram account – which means they get the same experience as everyone else around the world – or use Threads without a profile. People who use Threads without a profile can browse content on Threads, search for accounts, share content via link copying or platform sharing, and report Threads content, but can’t create a post or interact with content.

We’re excited to see more people using Threads and will continue to listen to community feedback to further improve the experience for everyone.

Fact-Checking on Threads

Early next year, our third-party fact-checking partners will be able to review and rate false content on Threads. Currently, when a fact-checker rates a piece of content as false on Facebook or Instagram, we extend that fact-check rating to near-identical content on Threads, but fact-checkers cannot rate Threads content on its own.

We recently gave Instagram and Facebook users more controls, allowing them to decide how much sensitive or, if they’re in the US, how much fact-checked content they see on each app. Consistent with that approach, we’re also bringing these controls to Threads to give people in the US the ability to choose whether they want to increase, lower or maintain the default level of demotions on fact-checked content in their Feed. If they choose to see less sensitive content on Instagram, that setting will also be applied on Threads.

Update on October 26, 2023 at 12:00PM PT:

We’re adding two new ways to spark conversation on Threads using polls and GIFs.

With polls, you can pose a question with up to four answer choices. The poll will run for 24 hours and you can control who can respond to the poll, the same way you can control who can reply to a post. You have to vote to see current results – and once you vote, you’ll be notified when the poll ends to see the final results and join the conversation.

We’re also making it easier to share GIFs on Threads. In a new post or reply, select the GIF icon to bring up the GIF library, where you can choose from what’s trending or search for a specific GIF.

Last week, Mark Zuckerberg announced that we began testing keyword search on Threads in Australia and New Zealand. Today, we’ll start rolling out keyword search in English and Spanish, in countries where most people post in those languages – such as Argentina, India, Mexico, the UK, and the US – on both mobile and web. We’re working on bringing the feature to other languages and countries as soon as we can. And we’re continuing to listen to your feedback to improve the search experience.

Update on August 22, 2023 at 8:00AM PT:

Mark Zuckerberg just announced that we’re rolling out a web experience for Threads over the coming days. The new logged-in experience for web lets you post a Thread, view your feed, and interact with other people’s Threads. We’re working hard to bring this experience to parity with mobile and will add more functions to the web version in the coming weeks.

Update on August 9, 2023 at 10:00AM PT:

We’ve been working on adding new Threads features as quickly as possible, and Mark Zuckerberg just announced that we’re rolling out three new ones. You can now:

Share a thread to Instagram DMs

Use the new mention button to easily mention people in your Thread

Edit the automatically generated alt-text description of photos and videos before posting

We launched the ability to view posts you’ve liked in your settings and sort your followers by latest first or earliest first.

We also recently added an option for a chronological feed of only people you’re following. So now you can see both: a For you feed that includes a mix of posts from profiles you follow and recommended content, as well as a Following feed that only shows posts from people you follow.

Threads posts are also now automatically translated based on the language they’re written in and the language setting of the person viewing it. If you see a thread in a different language, and your language is available as a translation, you can tap the translation button at the bottom right of the post or reply to see it.

We’ll continue listening to feedback and launching more features that improve people’s experience on Threads.

Mark Zuckerberg just announced the initial version of Threads, an app built by the Instagram team for sharing with text. Whether you’re a creator or a casual poster, Threads offers a new, separate space for real-time updates and public conversations. We are working toward making Threads compatible with the open, interoperable social networks that we believe can shape the future of the internet.

Instagram is where billions of people around the world connect over photos and videos. Our vision with Threads is to take what Instagram does best and expand that to text, creating a positive and creative space to express your ideas. Just like on Instagram, with Threads you can follow and connect with friends and creators who share your interests – including the people you follow on Instagram and beyond. And you can use our existing suite of safety and user controls.

Join the Conversation from Instagram

It’s easy to get started with Threads: simply use your Instagram account to log in. Your Instagram username and verification will carry over, with the option to customize your profile specifically for Threads.

Everyone who is under 16 (or under 18 in certain countries) will be defaulted into a private profile when they join Threads. You can choose to follow the same accounts you do on Instagram, and find more people who care about the same things you do. The core accessibility features available on Instagram today, such as screen reader support and AI-generated image descriptions, are also enabled on Threads.

Your feed on Threads includes threads posted by people you follow, and recommended content from new creators you haven’t discovered yet. Posts can be up to 500 characters long and include links, photos, and videos up to 5 minutes in length. You can easily share a Threads post to your Instagram story, or share your post as a link on any other platform you choose.

Tune Out the Noise

We built Threads with tools to enable positive, productive conversations. You can control who can mention you or reply to you within Threads. Like on Instagram, you can add hidden words to filter out replies to your threads that contain specific words. You can unfollow, block, restrict or report a profile on Threads by tapping the three-dot menu, and any accounts you’ve blocked on Instagram will automatically be blocked on Threads.

As with all our products, we’re taking safety seriously, and we’ll enforce Instagram’s Community Guidelines on content and interactions in the app. Since 2016 we’ve invested more than $16 billion in building up the teams and technologies needed to protect our users, and we remain focused on advancing our industry-leading integrity efforts and investments to protect our community.

Compatible with Interoperable Networks

Soon, we are planning to make Threads compatible with ActivityPub, the open social networking protocol established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the body responsible for the open standards that power the modern web. This would make Threads interoperable with other apps that also support the ActivityPub protocol, such as Mastodon and WordPress – allowing new types of connections that are simply not possible on most social apps today. Other platforms including Tumblr have shared plans to support the ActivityPub protocol in the future.

We’re committed to giving you more control over your audience on Threads – our plan is to work with ActivityPub to provide you the option to stop using Threads and transfer your content to another service. Our vision is that people using compatible apps will be able to follow and interact with people on Threads without having a Threads account, and vice versa, ushering in a new era of diverse and interconnected networks. If you have a public profile on Threads, this means your posts would be accessible from other apps, allowing you to reach new people with no added effort. If you have a private profile, you’d be able to approve users on Threads who want to follow you and interact with your content, similar to your experience on Instagram.

The benefits of open social networking protocols go well beyond the ways people can follow each other. Developers can build new types of features and user experiences that can easily plug into other open social networks, accelerating the pace of innovation and experimentation. Each compatible app can set its own community standards and content moderation policies, meaning people have the freedom to choose spaces that align with their values. We believe this decentralized approach, similar to the protocols governing email and the web itself, will play an important role in the future of online platforms.

Threads is Meta’s first app envisioned to be compatible with an open social networking protocol – we hope that by joining this fast-growing ecosystem of interoperable services, Threads will help people find their community, no matter what app they use.

What’s Next

We’re rolling out Threads today in more than 100 countries for iOS and Android, and people in those countries can download the app from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

In addition to working toward making Threads compatible with the ActivityPub protocol, soon we’ll be adding a number of new features to help you continue to discover threads and creators you’re interested in, including improved recommendations in feed and a more robust search function that makes it easier to follow topics and trends in real time.

We’re excited to hear your feedback as we work to build new features and introduce fun new ways to connect on the app.","(technology, r&d participant, instagram)

"Mark Zuckerberg just announced Meta Quest 3, our next-generation virtual and mixed reality headset, which launches later this year. It features higher resolution, stronger performance, breakthrough Meta Reality technology, and a slimmer, more comfortable form factor. Quest 3 will ship in all countries where Meta Quest is currently supported this fall. The 128GB headset starts at $499.99 USD, and we’ll offer an additional storage option for those who want some extra space. Mark your calendars because we’ll have lots more to share at Meta Connect, which returns this year on September 27.

Quest 3 is the supercharged all-in-one headset you’ve been waiting for — no wires required. Sign up to be the first to learn about Meta Quest 3.

Our Most Powerful Headset Yet

Quest 3 combines our highest resolution display and pancake optics to make content look better than ever. To power those extra pixels, this will be the first headset to feature a next-generation Snapdragon chipset developed in collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies. That next-gen Snapdragon chipset delivers more than twice the graphical performance as the previous generation Snapdragon GPU in Quest 2 — meaning you’ll get smoother performance and incredibly crisp details in immersive games.

Immersive VR + Breakthrough Meta Reality in a Single Device

On Quest 3, our best-in-class Meta Reality technology lets you seamlessly blend your physical world with the virtual one. These new experiences go beyond today’s mixed reality by intelligently understanding and responding to objects in your physical space and allowing you to navigate that space in natural, intuitive ways that were nearly impossible before. High-fidelity color Passthrough, innovative machine learning, and spatial understanding let you interact with virtual content and the physical world simultaneously, creating limitless possibilities to explore. Now you can play a virtual board game on your kitchen table with Demeo, decorate your living room with virtual art courtesy of Painting VR, or dive into a fully immersive world to do things that are simply not possible otherwise.

Quest 3 makes Meta Reality available to even more people and at a lower price point, making it our first mass-market offering to deliver both cutting-edge VR and MR experiences in a single device, setting a new benchmark for future headsets.

Redesigned for Comfort + Control

With a 40% slimmer optic profile* compared to Quest 2, Quest 3 is a sleeker, more comfortable headset. We also completely redesigned Quest 3’s Touch Plus controllers with a more streamlined and ergonomic form factor. Thanks to our advances in tracking technology, we’ve dropped the outer tracking rings so the controllers feel like a more natural extension of your hands and take up less space. We also included TruTouch haptics that first debuted in Touch Pro to help you feel the action like never before. You can even upgrade to our fully self-tracked Meta Quest Touch Pro Controllers for a premium experience. And hand tracking will be supported out of the box, so you can explore without controllers, thanks to Direct Touch that lets you use just your hands to interact with virtual objects.

World’s Best Library of Immersive Content

Quest 3 is compatible with the Quest 2 catalog of over 500 VR games, apps, and experiences (and counting), and we’ve got even more exciting new VR and MR titles lined up for launch. That means Quest 3 will have the world’s best library of immersive experiences on day one. Be sure to tune in to today’s Meta Quest Gaming Showcase for a rundown of new games and updates coming to the Quest Platform — plus a sneak peek at Quest 3’s AAA flagship adventure.

Quest 2 Gets New Lower Prices, Plus a Performance Upgrade

We’re excited for Quest 3 and look forward to sharing more later this year at Connect. But what about Quest 2?

Meta Quest 2 changed the face of VR when it first hit the scene in 2020, ushering in a new era of gaming, fitness, and more. It’s already one of the most affordable ways to get into VR — and it’s about to get even better. Starting June 4, we’re lowering the price of Quest 2 to $299.99 USD for the 128GB SKU and $349.99 USD for the 256GB SKU, helping even more people access the magic of all-in-one VR and our vast content library.

But that’s not all! In an upcoming software update, we’re updating the Quest 2 and Quest Pro GPU and CPU. Quest 2 and Pro will see an up-to 26% CPU performance increase with an up-to 19% GPU speed increase for Quest 2 and 11% for Quest Pro. As developers take advantage of these changes, you can expect smoother gameplay, a more responsive UI, and richer content on both headsets. And we’re enabling Dynamic Resolution Scaling for both Quest 2 and Quest Pro, so games and apps can take advantage of increased pixel density without dropping frames.

While Quest 3 sets a new standard for mixed reality, immersive gaming, and what a mainstream VR headset can be, Quest 2 remains our most affordable entry point to VR and Pro is optimized for work use cases, with face and eye tracking for more authentic self-expression in meetings. We’ll continue to sell Quest 2 and Pro alongside Quest 3, as well as continue shipping new software updates to make the Quest experience even better.

From games, to fitness apps, professional collaboration tools and more, Quest has something for everyone. And we can’t wait to welcome even more people to the Meta Quest community.

"AI is enabling new forms of connection and expression, thanks to the power of generative technologies. And today at Connect, we introduced you to new AI experiences and features that can enhance your connections with others – and give you the tools to be more creative, expressive, and productive.

AI Stickers

Billions of stickers are sent across our platforms every month, adding another fun and creative way for people to communicate and express themselves. Today, we announced new AI stickers that enable you to effortlessly generate customized stickers for your chats and stories. Using technology from Llama 2 and our foundational model for image generation called Emu, our AI tool turns your text prompts into multiple unique, high-quality stickers in seconds. This new feature, which is rolling out to select English-language users over the next month in WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and Facebook Stories, provides infinitely more options to convey how you’re feeling at any moment. AI stickers will roll out to select English language users over the next month.

Image Editing With AI

Soon, you’ll be able to transform your images or even co-create AI-generated images with friends. Restyle and backdrop – two new features that are coming soon to Instagram – use the technology from Emu. Backdrop also leverages learnings from our Segment Anything Model.

Restyle lets you reimagine your images by applying the visual styles you describe. Think of typing a descriptor like “watercolor” or a more detailed prompt like “collage from magazines and newspapers, torn edges” to describe the new look and feel of the image you want to create.

Backdrop changes the scene or background of your image. Prompts like “put me in front of a sublime aurora borealis” or “surrounded by puppies” will cue the tool to create an image of the primary subject in the foreground with the background you described.

We know how important transparency is when it comes to the content AI generates, so images created with restyle and backdrop will indicate the use of AI to reduce the chances of people mistaking them for human-generated content. We’re also experimenting with forms of visible and invisible markers.

We want these experiences to be safe and trustworthy, while bringing new forms of creativity, entertainment, and expression into your day.

An Assistant That Spans Our Apps and Devices

Meta AI is a new assistant you can interact with like a person, available on WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and coming soon to Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest 3. It’s powered by a custom model that leverages technology from Llama 2 and our latest large language model (LLM) research. In text-based chats, Meta AI has access to real-time information through our search partnership with Bing and offers a tool for image generation.

Here’s an example of how you might use Meta AI:

Imagine you and your friends are in a group chat discussing which trailhead to try in Santa Cruz. Meta AI surfaces options directly in the chat, so you can decide as a group which location to explore. What if after the hike you want a creative way to commemorate the day? Meta AI can help. Type “@MetaAI /imagine” followed by a descriptive text prompt like “create a button badge with a hiker and redwood trees,” and it will create a digital merit badge in the chat with your friends.

A Universe of Characters at Your Fingertips

Our journey with AIs is just beginning, and it isn’t purely about building AIs that only answer questions. We’ve been creating AIs that have more personality, opinions, and interests, and are a bit more fun to interact with. Along with Meta AI, there are 28 more AIs that you can message on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. You can think of these AIs as a new cast of characters – all with unique backstories.

And because interacting with them should feel like talking to familiar people, we did something to build on this even further. We partnered with cultural icons and influencers to play and embody some of these AIs. They’ll each have profiles on Instagram and Facebook, so you can explore what they’re all about.

Charli D’Amelio as Coco, Dance enthusiast

Chris Paul as Perry, Pro golfer helping you perfect your stroke

Dwyane Wade as Victor, Ironman triathlete motivating you to be your best self

Izzy Adesanya as Luiz, Showy MMA prospect who can back up his trash talk

Kendall Jenner as Billie, No-BS, ride-or-die companion

LaurDIY as Dylan, Quirky DIY and Craft expert and companion for Gen Z

MrBeast as Zach, The big brother who will roast you — because he cares

Naomi Osaka as Tamika, Anime-obsessed Sailor Senshi in training

Paris Hilton as Amber, Detective partner for solving whodunnits

Raven Ross as Angie, Workout class queen who balances fitness with meditation

Roy Choi as Max, Seasoned sous chef for culinary tips and tricks

Sam Kerr as Sally, Free-spirited friend who’ll tell you when to take a deep breath

Snoop Dogg as Dungeon Master, Adventure awaits, begin your next great story

Tom Brady as Bru, Wisecracking sports debater who pulls no punches

We’re going to start rolling these out in beta in the United States today. We’ll add new characters in the coming weeks played by Bear Grylls, Chloe Kim, and Josh Richards among others.

It’s still early days for our AIs. Right now, their knowledge base – with the exception of Meta AI, Bru, and Perry – is limited to information that largely existed prior to 2023, which means some responses may be dated. We aim to bring search to many more of our AIs in the coming months – like we have done with Meta AI – so that conversations can be timely and relevant too.

We are committed to building responsibly with safety in mind. We are continuing to test and evolve the capabilities of our AIs, and will improve the experience over time through what we learn from your interactions with them. Your direct feedback and the conversations you have with our AIs are core parts of what will help us improve our AI models, and ultimately enhance the experience at scale.

What’s Coming Next

We introduced AI studio today, the platform that supports the creation of our AIs and we plan to make it available for people outside of Meta – coders and non-coders alike – to build AIs. Developers will be able to build third-party AIs for our messaging services with our APIs in the coming weeks, starting on Messenger then expanding to WhatsApp.

Businesses will also be able to create AIs that reflect their brand’s values and improve customer service experiences. From small businesses looking to scale to large brands wanting to enhance communications, AIs can help businesses engage with their customers across our apps. We’re launching this in alpha and will scale it further next year.

And for creators, they’ll be able to build AIs that extend their virtual presence across our apps. These AIs will have to be sanctioned by them and directly controlled by the creator.

We’re also building a sandbox that will be released in the coming year, enabling anyone to experiment with creating their own AI. As our universe of AIs continues to grow and evolve, we’ll bring this sandbox to the metaverse, giving you the chance to build AIs that adopt an even greater level of realism, embodiment, and connectedness.","(technology, product manufacturer, meta)

"Update December 12, 2023 at 12:05PM PT:

Our next-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses include Meta AI for an integrated hands-free, on-the-go experience. You can use Meta AI to spark creativity, get information and control the glasses just by using your voice. Today we’re introducing new updates to make the glasses smarter and more helpful than ever before.

We’re launching an early access program for Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses customers to try out and provide feedback on upcoming features ahead of their release. Starting today, customers who have opted in to the program will have access to a new test of multimodal AI-powered capabilities. You won’t just be able to speak with your glasses — the glasses will be able to understand what you’re seeing using the built-in camera. You can ask Meta AI for help writing a caption for a photo taken during a hike or you can ask Meta AI to describe an object you’re holding.

As you try these new experiences, bear in mind that, as we test, these multimodal AI features may not always get it right. We’re continuing to learn what works best and improving the experience for everyone. Your feedback will help make Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses better and smarter over time. This early access program is open to Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses owners in the US. Those interested can enroll using the Meta View app on iOS and Android. Please make sure you have the latest version of the app installed and your smart glasses are updated as well.

In addition to the early access program, we’re beginning to roll out the ability for Meta AI on the glasses to retrieve real-time information powered in part by Bing. You can ask Meta AI about sports scores or information on local landmarks, restaurants, stocks and more. For example, you can say, “Hey Meta, who won the Boston Marathon this year in the men’s division?” or “Hey Meta, is there a pharmacy close by?” Real-time search is rolling out in phases to Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses customers in the US.

Originally published on December 6, 2023 at 9:00AM PT:

It’s been an incredible year for AI at Meta. We introduced you to new AI experiences across our apps and devices, opened access to our Llama family of large language models, and published research breakthroughs like Emu Video and Emu Edit that will unlock new capabilities in our products next year. We can’t wait for what’s to come next year with AI advancements in content generation, voice and multimodality that will enable us to deliver new creative and immersive applications. Today, we’re sharing updates to some of our core AI experiences and new capabilities you can discover across our family of apps.

The Evolution of Meta AI

Meta AI is our virtual assistant you can access to answer questions, generate photorealistic images and more. We’re making it more helpful, with more detailed responses on mobile and more accurate summaries of search results. We’ve even made it so you’re more likely to get a helpful response to a wider range of requests. To interact with Meta AI, start a new message and select “Create an AI chat” on our messaging platforms, or type “@MetaAI” in a group chat followed by what you’d like the assistant to help with. You can also say “Hey Meta” while wearing your Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.

And Meta AI is now helping you outside of chats, too. It’s doing some of the heavy lifting behind the scenes to make our product experiences on Facebook and Instagram more fun and useful than ever before. The large language model technology behind Meta AI is used to give people in various English-language markets options for AI-generated post comment suggestions and community chat topic suggestions in groups, serve search results, and even enhance product copy in Shops. It’s also powering an entirely new standalone experience for creative hobbyists called imagine with Meta AI.

Create and Riff on Images With Friends

One of Meta AI’s most commonly used features across our messaging apps is imagine, our text-to-image generation capability that lets you create and share images on the fly. We’re always looking for ways to make our AIs even more fun and social, so today we’re excited to add a new feature to Meta AI on Messenger and Instagram called reimagine. Here’s how it works in group chat: Meta AI generates and shares the initial image you requested, then your friend can press and hold on the picture to riff on it with a simple text prompt and Meta AI will generate an entirely new image. Now you can kick images back and forth, having a laugh as you try to one-up each other with increasingly wild ideas.

Discover New Experiences With Reels in Meta AI

Sometimes it’s not enough to simply read about something — you want to see it or experience it through more than text. Reels let you do just that. They’re a great way to discover new content, connect with creators and find inspiration. And now, we’re starting to roll out Reels in Meta AI chats, too.

Say you’re planning a trip to Tokyo with friends in your group chat, you can ask Meta AI to recommend the best places to visit and share Reels of the top sites to help you decide which attractions are must-sees.

This is just the first example of how we’ll build even deeper integrations across our apps to make Meta AI an even more connected and personal assistant over time.

Enhancing Your Experience on Facebook

We’re also continuing to innovate on Facebook to help people with everyday experiences, making expression and discovery easier than ever before.

With Meta AI under the hood, we’re exploring ways for you to use AI to help you create the perfect birthday greeting to share with your bestie, edit your own Feed posts, draft a clever introduction for your Facebook Dating profile or even set up a new Group.

This slideshow requires JavaScript.

We’re also testing ways to easily create and share AI-generated images on Facebook — like using Meta AI to convert images from landscape to portrait orientation so you can share them more easily to Stories.

We’re also testing using Meta AI to surface relevant information in Groups, so you don’t miss out on the conversations that matter most, and suggest topics for new chats, helping you stay active in your communities. On Marketplace, we’re testing using Meta AI to help people learn more about the products they’re considering buying and easily find related or alternative items. And we’re testing using Meta AI to improve our search capabilities for friends, Pages, Groups and Marketplace listings.

Helping Creators Respond to Their Fans

We want to give creators generative AI tools to help them work more efficiently and connect with more of their community. Building off our recent updates on Instagram, we’re starting to test suggested replies in DMs to help creators engage with their audiences faster and more easily. When creators in the test open a message in their DMs, Meta AI will work in the background to draft relevant replies for consideration based on their tone and content.

Experience Imagine With Meta AI

We’ve enjoyed hearing from people about how they’re using imagine, Meta AI’s text-to-image generation feature, to make fun and creative content in chats. Today, we’re expanding access to imagine outside of chats, making it available in the US to start at imagine.meta.com. This standalone experience for creative hobbyists lets you create images with technology from Emu, our image foundation model. While our messaging experience is designed for more playful, back-and-forth interactions, you can now create free images on the web, too.

Chatting With Our AIs

Meta AI isn’t the only AI we’re evolving. We’re also improving our other AIs based on your feedback. Search is coming to more of our AIs. Two of our sports-related AIs, Bru and Perry, have been serving up responses powered by Bing since day one. And now we’re rolling out this functionality to Luiz, Coco, Lorena, Tamika, Izzy and Jade, too.

In addition, we’re experimenting with a new feature for select AIs to add long-term memory, so what they learn from your conversation isn’t lost after your chat is over. That means you can return to a particular AI and pick up where you left off. Our goal is to bring the potential for deeper connections and extended conversational capabilities to your chats with AIs, including Billie, Carter, Scarlett, Zach, Victor, Sally and Leo. You can also clear your chat history with our AIs at any time. Check out our Generative AI Privacy Guide for more info.

To chat with our AIs, start a new message and select “Create an AI chat” on Instagram, Messenger or WhatsApp. They’re now available to anyone in the US.

Invisible Watermarking, Red Teaming and More to Come

We’re committed to building responsibly with safety in mind across our products and know how important transparency is when it comes to the content AI generates. Many images created with our tools indicate the use of AI to reduce the chances of people mistaking them for human-generated content. In the coming weeks, we’ll add invisible watermarking to the imagine with Meta AI experience for increased transparency and traceability. The invisible watermark is applied with a deep learning model. While it’s imperceptible to the human eye, the invisible watermark can be detected with a corresponding model. It’s resilient to common image manipulations like cropping, color change (brightness, contrast, etc.), screen shots and more. We aim to bring invisible watermarking to many of our products with AI-generated images in the future.

We’re also continuing to invest in red teaming, which has been a part of our culture for years. As part of that work, we pressure test our generative AI research and features that use large language models (LLMs) with prompts we expect could generate risky outputs. Recently, we introduced Multi-round Automatic Red-Teaming (MART), a framework for improving LLM safety that trains an adversarial and target LLM through automatic iterative adversarial red teaming. We’re working on incorporating the MART framework into our AIs to continuously red team and improve safety.

Finally, we continue to listen to people’s feedback based on their experiences with our AIs, including Meta AI.

We’re still just scratching the surface of what AI can do. Stay tuned for more updates in the new year.","(meta, product manufacturer, ray-banmetasmart glasses)

"Update on June 27, 2023 at 7:30 AM PT:

We’re excited to begin rolling out Meta Verified to most markets globally over the coming months.

We’ve heard positive feedback from creators in our initial tests and continue to gather input about what’s most valuable for subscribers. We’ll continue to evolve Meta Verified based on these learnings and explore new features and benefits that create more value for subscribers.

Update on June 7, 2023 at 7:30 AM PT:

Meta Verified is now available in India and will soon be available in Brazil.

Update on May 31, 2023 at 9:00 AM PT:

Meta Verified is now available in Canada.

Update on May 16, 2023 at 7:40 AM PT:

Meta Verified is now available in the United Kingdom.

Update on March 17, 2023 at 11 AM PT:

We’re expanding our test of Meta Verified to the US after seeing good results from our early testing. This test in the US will reflect some initial learnings and feedback. We’re removing increased reach as a subscription feature for now, as we gather more feedback and further evolve Meta Verified. We’re exploring elements to add to the subscription as we roll out to more places and will share more when we’re ready.

Originally published on February 19, 2023 at 12 PM PT:

To help up-and-coming creators grow their presence and build community faster, today Mark Zuckerberg announced that we’ll begin testing a new offering called Meta Verified, a subscription bundle on Instagram and Facebook that includes a verified badge that authenticates your account with government ID, proactive account protection, access to account support, and increased visibility and reach. We’re starting with a gradual test in Australia and New Zealand later this week to learn what’s most valuable, and we hope to bring Meta Verified to the rest of the world soon.

Some of the top requests we get from creators are for broader access to verification and account support, in addition to more features to increase visibility and reach. Since last year, we’ve been thinking about how to unlock access to these features through a paid offering.

With Meta Verified, you’ll get:

A verified badge, confirming you’re the real you and that your account has been authenticated with a government ID.¹

More protection from impersonation with proactive account monitoring for impersonators who might target people with growing online audiences.

Help when you need it with access to a real person for common account issues.

Increased visibility and reach with prominence in some areas of the platform– like search, comments and recommendations.²

Exclusive features to express yourself in unique ways.³

Meta Verified is available for direct purchase on Instagram or Facebook in Australia and New Zealand starting later this week. People can purchase a monthly subscription for (USD) $11.99 on the web and (USD) $14.99 on iOS and Android.4

As we test and learn, there will be no changes to accounts on Instagram and Facebook that are already verified based on prior requirements. Long term, we want to build a subscription offering that’s valuable to everyone, including creators, businesses and our community at large. As part of this vision, we are evolving the meaning of verified accounts on our apps so we can expand access to verification and more people can trust the accounts they interact with are authentic.

Building Safety from the Beginning

It’s important to feel confident that your identity and accounts are safe and that the people you’re interacting with are who they say they are. That’s why we’re building a series of checks into Meta Verified before, during, and after someone applies.

To be eligible, accounts must meet minimum activity requirements, such as prior posting history, and be at least 18 years old .

Applicants are then required to submit a government ID that matches the profile name and photo of the Facebook or Instagram account they’re applying for .

Subscriptions will include proactive monitoring for account impersonation.

We’re also committed to continuous monitoring and review of reported violations, as well as taking swift action against those who try to evade our systems.

To learn more about Meta Verified visit Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Channel on Instagram on your mobile device.

1. Where available, some subscribers may be required to submit a selfie video as part of the authentication process.

2. We’ll offer exclusive stickers on Facebook and Instagram Stories and Facebook Reels, and 100 free stars a month on Facebook so you can show your support for other creators.

3. AUD 19.99 on web, AUD 24.99 on iOS and Android. NZD 23.99 on web, NZD 29.99 on iOS and Android. Subscription features are the same for both web and app purchases.

4. Businesses are not eligible to apply for Meta Verified at this time.","(technology, product manufacturer, meta)

"Recent breakthroughs in AI, and generative AI in particular, have captured the public’s imagination and demonstrated what those developing these technologies have long known — they have the potential to help people do incredible things, create a new era of economic and social opportunities, and give individuals, creators, and businesses new ways to express themselves and connect with people.

We believe an open approach is the right one for the development of today’s AI models, especially those in the generative space where the technology is rapidly advancing. By making AI models available openly, they can benefit everyone. Giving businesses, startups, entrepreneurs, and researchers access to tools developed at a scale that would be challenging to build themselves, backed by computing power they might not otherwise access, will open up a world of opportunities for them to experiment, innovate in exciting ways, and ultimately benefit from economically and socially.

And we believe it’s safer. Opening access to today’s AI models means a generation of developers and researchers can stress test them, identifying and solving problems fast, as a community. By seeing how these tools are used by others, our own teams can learn from them, improve those tools, and fix vulnerabilities.

Meta has put exploratory research, open source, and collaboration with academic and industry partners at the heart of our AI efforts for over a decade. We’ve seen first-hand how innovation in the open can lead to technologies that benefit more people. Dozens of large language models have already been released and are driving progress by developers and researchers. They’re being used by businesses as core ingredients for new generative AI-powered experiences. We’ve been blown away by the huge demand for Llama 1 from researchers — with more than 100,000 requests for access to the large language model — and the amazing things they’ve achieved by building on top of it.

We’re now ready to open source the next version of Llama 2 and are making it available free of charge for research and commercial use. We’re including model weights and starting code for the pretrained model and conversational fine-tuned versions too. As Satya Nadella announced on stage at Microsoft Inspire, we’re taking our partnership to the next level with Microsoft as our preferred partner for Llama 2 and expanding our efforts in generative AI. Starting today, Llama 2 is available in the Azure AI model catalog, enabling developers using Microsoft Azure to build with it and leverage their cloud-native tools for content filtering and safety features. It is also optimized to run locally on Windows, giving developers a seamless workflow as they bring generative AI experiences to customers across different platforms. Llama 2 is available through Amazon Web Services (AWS), Hugging Face, and other providers too.

People and businesses have benefited from the longstanding partnership between Microsoft and Meta. Together we’ve introduced an open ecosystem for interchangeable AI frameworks, and we’ve co-authored research papers to advance the state of the art in AI. We’ve collaborated to scale the adoption of PyTorch — today’s leading AI framework created by Meta and the AI community — on Azure, and we’re among the founding members of the PyTorch Foundation. Microsoft and Meta recently joined a cohort of supporters that endorse the Partnership on AI’s framework for collective action in the creation and sharing of synthetic media. Our partnership extends outside of AI and into the metaverse too to deliver immersive experiences for the future of work and play.

Now, with this expanded partnership, Microsoft and Meta are supporting an open approach to provide increased access to foundational AI technologies to the benefits of businesses globally. It’s not just Meta and Microsoft that believe in democratizing access to today’s AI models. We have a broad range of diverse supporters around the world who believe in this approach too — including companies that have given us early feedback and are excited to build new products with Llama 2, cloud providers that will include Llama 2 in their offerings for customers, research institutions who are collaborating with us on the safe and responsible deployment of large generative models, and people across tech, academia, and policy who see the benefits as we do.

A Focus on Responsibility

Our open source approach promotes transparency and access. We know that while AI has brought huge advances to society, it also comes with risk. We are committed to building responsibly and are providing a number of resources to help those who use Llama 2 do so too.

Red-Teaming Exercises: Our fine-tuned models have been red-teamed — tested for safety — through internal and external efforts. The team worked to generate adversarial prompts to facilitate model fine-tuning. In addition, we commissioned third parties to conduct external adversarial testing across our fine-tuned models to similarly identify gaps in performance. These safety fine-tuning processes are iterative; we will continue to invest in safety through fine-tuning and benchmarking and plan to release updated fine-tuned models based on these efforts.

Transparency Schematic: We explain our fine-tuning and evaluation methods for the model and identify its shortcomings. Our transparency schematic, which is located within the research paper , discloses known challenges and issues we’ve experienced and provides insight into mitigations taken and future ones we intend to explore.

Responsible Use Guide: We created this guide as a resource to support developers with best practices for responsible development and safety evaluations. It outlines best practices reflective of current, state-of-the-art research on responsible generative AI discussed across the industry and the AI research community.

Acceptable Use Policy: We put a policy in place that prohibits certain use cases to help ensure that these models are being used fairly and responsibly.

Meta has also created new initiatives to harness the insight and creativity of individuals, researchers, and developers around the world to get feedback on how the models are performing and how they might be improved.

Open Innovation AI Research Community: Today, we also launched a new partnership program for academic researchers that aims to deepen our understanding of the responsible development and sharing of large language models. Researchers may apply to join a community of practitioners to share learnings on this important topic, and the community will form a research agenda to pursue going forward.

Llama Impact Challenge: We want to activate the community of innovators who aspire to use Llama to solve hard problems. We are launching a challenge to encourage a diverse set of public, non-profit, and for-profit entities to use Llama 2 to address environmental, education and other important challenges. The challenge rules will be available prior to the start of it.

Conclusion

Throughout our company’s history, we’ve experienced the benefits of an open source approach when innovating in other areas of the business. Our engineers developed and shared frameworks that are now industry standards — like React, a leading framework for making web and mobile applications, and PyTorch, which is now the leading framework for AI. These became commonly used infrastructure for the entire technology industry. We believe that openly sharing today’s large language models will support the development of helpful and safer generative AI too.

We look forward to seeing what the world builds with Llama 2.","(meta, r&d participant, microsoft)

"Today at Meta Connect, in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, we announced our next-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses collection. We redesigned these from the ground up, improving all the core features of the first generation while adding new capabilities that have never been seen on a pair of smart glasses before. They start at $299 USD. Pre-orders are open now on meta.com and ray-ban.com, and the smart glasses will be available for purchase online and in retail stores starting October 17.*

Since we launched our first-generation smart glasses built in partnership with EssilorLuxottica, millions of moments have been captured and shared. From music festivals and birthday parties to first steps, graduations, and beyond, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses free you from the constraints of a hand-held camera. Instead of keeping the world at arm’s length (or worse, missing out on the action completely as you struggle with your smartphone’s lock screen), Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses let you snap a photo or video clip from your unique point of view — allowing you to not only relive the moment, but really live in the moment, too.

We redesigned our next-generation glasses from the ground up, listening to feedback from the community and taking the time to understand what people love about the product — like the effortlessly cool form factor, hands-free convenience, and open-ear audio — as well as the areas where we could improve, like overall media quality and comfort. We’ve improved all those core features of the first generation and added a couple completely new features that have never been seen on a pair of smart glasses before.

Here are some highlights:

Improved audio: We have all-new custom designed speakers with extended bass, higher maximum volume, and improved directional audio that provides reduced audio leakage for improved calls, music, and podcasts — even in noisy or windy environments. And when you’re recording a video, the newly designed five-microphone array supports immersive audio recording, so you’ll be able to capture sounds exactly how you originally experienced them — whether in front of you, from the sides, the rear, and even above.

Share your point of view: A new ultra-wide 12 MP camera translates to improved quality for your photos and 1080p videos up to 60 seconds, so whether you’re taking in breathtaking views during a hike or living your best life at an art show, the evidence of your exploits will be as epic as the real deal. You can even directly share photos to friends and family from your glasses with a simple “send a photo” voice command.

Power up: Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are powered by the all-new Qualcomm Snapdragon AR1 Gen1 Platform, which enables higher quality photo and video processing and even faster compute. And the glasses come with a redesigned and sleek charging case, which holds up to eight additional charges (for a total of 36 hours of use) while being slimmer and even smaller.

The look(s): Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses come in the timeless Wayfarer style you already know and love, plus a brand-new Headliner design for a more retro look — both of which are available in Matte Black and Shiny Black. We’re also introducing three new transparent frame colors in Jeans, Rebel Black, and Caramel that celebrate the tech inside. And with over 150 different custom frame and lens combinations on the Ray-Ban Remix platform, you can mix and match to make the glasses your own on ray-ban.com. We’ve also made them prescription-lens compatible.

This slideshow requires JavaScript.

Comfort and control: We reduced the weight of the glasses and slimmed down the profile in every direction, making them lighter and more comfortable. And the glasses are now water-resistant (IPX4). We also improved the touchpad and added interaction earcons so the glasses respond much faster and more reliably to your commands.

Hands-free livestreaming: You can now livestream from the glasses to Facebook or Instagram. And you can see the comments in your preview, or tap and hold on the side of your glasses to hear them out loud to engage with your community as you’re living in the moment.

Meta AI: We’ve integrated Meta AI, our advanced conversational assistant, on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and optimized it for a hands-free, on-the-go experience. By saying “Hey Meta,” you can engage with Meta AI to spark creativity, get information, and control features — just by using your voice. Meta AI features will be available in the US in beta only at launch.

Get all the details on our Meta Quest blog.

"Update on January 18, 2024 at 3:00AM PT:

Sleep is important, particularly for young people, so we’re launching new nighttime nudges that will show up when teens have spent more than 10 minutes on Instagram in places like Reels or Direct Messages late at night. They’ll remind teens that it’s late, and encourage them to close the app.

Update on November 9, 2023 at 9:00AM PT:

Parental supervision tools are now available globally on Facebook, in addition to Instagram, Messenger, and Horizon Worlds. Parents can access Facebook supervision via Settings to see insights like time spent, schedule breaks for their teens and access expert resources on managing their teens’ time online. We’re also adding more supervision features to Messenger, including giving parents the ability to set scheduled breaks and view their teens’ blocked contacts.

Update on August 30, 2023 at 9:00PM PT:

Parental supervision tools on Messenger are now available globally.

Originally published on June 27, 2023 at 2:00AM PT:

Parental Supervision Tools on Messenger

Today, we’re announcing parental supervision tools on Messenger. Now parents and guardians can access Messenger supervision tools and resources from leading experts to support their teens through the Meta Family Center. Parental Supervision on Messenger is available in the US, UK, and Canada today, with plans to expand to more countries around the world in the coming months.

These tools allow parents to see how their teen uses Messenger, from how much time they’re spending on messaging to providing information about their teen’s message settings. These tools do not allow parents to read their teen’s messages.

Specifically, our first set of parental supervision tools on Messenger will allow parents and guardians to:

View how much time their teen spends on Messenger

View and receive updates on their teen’s Messenger contacts list, as well as their teen’s privacy and safety settings

Get notified if their teen reports someone (if the teen chooses to share that information)

View who can message their teen (only their friends, friends of friends, or no one) and see if their teen changes this setting

View who can see their teen’s Messenger stories and get notified if these settings change

Over the next year, we’ll add more features to Parental Supervision on Messenger so parents can help their teens better manage their time and interactions, while still balancing their privacy as these tools function in both unencrypted and end-to-end encrypted chats.

Today’s update is part of our ongoing work to establish Family Center as one central place where parents and guardians can find resources and tools to help manage their teens’ experiences across Meta technologies, and strengthen the dialogue between parents and teens about their online lives.

Testing New Messaging Privacy Features

We want to protect people from unwanted interactions in Instagram DMs, and these protections are especially important when it comes to teens. We already show Safety Notices when adults who have shown potentially suspicious behavior message teens, and we restrict people over 19 years old from sending private messages to teens who don’t follow them. We’re now testing additional features to limit how people can interact with and message others who don’t follow them:

Before being able to message someone who doesn’t follow them, people must now send an invite to get their permission to connect. People can only send one invite at a time and can’t send more until the recipient accepts the invitation to connect.

We’ll limit these message request invites to text only, so people can’t send any photos, videos, or voice messages, or make calls, until the recipient has accepted the invite to chat. These changes mean people won’t receive unwanted photos, videos, or other types of media from people they don’t follow.

Nudging Teens to Manage Their Time on Facebook and Instagram

We want teens to feel good about the time they spend on our apps, which is why we’ve built features like Take a Break on Instagram. Soon, teens will also see a notification when they’ve spent 20 minutes on Facebook, prompting them to take time away from the app and set daily time limits. We’re also exploring a new nudge on Instagram that suggests teens close the app if they are scrolling Reels at night.

In January, we introduced Quiet Mode on Instagram, a new feature to help people focus and to encourage them to set boundaries with their friends and followers. For example, when you turn on Quiet Mode, you won’t receive any notifications, your profile’s activity status will change to let people know you’re in Quiet Mode, and we’ll automatically send an auto-reply when someone sends you a DM. We’re making Quiet Mode available to everyone on Instagram globally in the coming weeks.

Additional Parental Supervision Features on Instagram

We’ve added additional tools to Parental Supervision on Instagram to give parents more visibility into their teens’ experiences on the app and to prompt teens to have conversations with their parents with new notifications. These updates include:

A new notice to teens after they’ve blocked someone. The notice encourages teens to add their parents to supervise their Instagram account as an extra layer of support. Through this notice, we’re meeting teens at specific moments to remind them how they can benefit from parental guidance when it comes to navigating their online interactions.

In addition to seeing which accounts their teen follows and is followed by, parents will now be able to see how many friends their teen has in common with those accounts. This will help parents understand how well their teen knows these accounts, and help prompt offline conversations about those connections.

More ways for parents to customize which notifications from Parental Supervision on Instagram they want to receive and how often they receive them.

Today’s updates were designed to help teens feel in control of their online experiences and help parents feel equipped to support their teens. We’ll continue to collaborate with parents and experts to develop additional features that support teens and their families.","(messenger, service provider, parental supervision tools)

"Building on our efforts to simplify settings earlier this year, we’re moving a number of additional controls into Accounts Center to make it easier to manage your information across our apps.

Download Your Information and Access Your Information are now centralized in Accounts Center, and you can now download information from both your Facebook and Instagram accounts at the same time. For example, you might want to download photos that you’ve uploaded to both platforms – now you can, with a single action. Or you can still choose to download your information for Facebook and Instagram separately.

We’re also expanding two controls that were previously only available on Facebook – Activity Off-Meta Technologies (formerly known as off-Facebook activity) and Transfer Your Information are now available for Instagram as well. Activity Off-Meta Technologies allows you to manage how information other businesses send to us is connected to your Facebook and Instagram accounts. You can easily review the businesses that are sharing data with Meta, disconnect specific ones to further personalize your experience, or clear this data entirely – it’s up to you.

By expanding Transfer Your Information to Instagram, you can now transfer all of your Instagram photos and videos to other services, making it much easier to share and save memories. This marks a big step forward in data portability. For example, if you’re interested in using a third-party service to create and print a photo album using photos you’ve uploaded to Instagram, this is now easier than ever.

We’ve heard that people want to be able to easily make decisions for multiple apps at once, so moving these settings into Accounts Center aims to address that by letting people choose their settings for all of our apps simultaneously. And for people who prefer to have different settings for each app, that’s still an option too.

You can access Accounts Center in the Settings menu on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.

We’ll continue to find ways to make it easier for people to customize how they use and interact with our apps and technologies.","(meta, parent-subsidiary, instagram)

"Update on February 15, 2024 at 7:00AM PT:

We want to make more data from our platforms available to academic researchers so they can pursue public interest research, while doing so in a way that respects both people’s privacy and our compliance obligations.

In the months since we rolled out our Meta Content Library tool we’ve been gathering feedback from researchers to ensure the sort of publicly-accessible data they need is available to them in a way that’s effective for their research. Based on that feedback, we are adding some new data and features.

One of the biggest requests was to make content from public figures more accessible to researchers so it is easier to study the impact their activity on Facebook and Instagram has on politics, society and culture. So, in the coming weeks, we’re making it possible for researchers to download certain publicly-accessible content posted by public figures and widely-known figures and entities. This data will be accessible in a downloadable CSV format through the Meta Content Library user interface and won’t require access through a virtual clean room.

In the next few months, we’ll also be adding ‘comments’ as a new data type within the Meta Content Library. This will help researchers study how people around the world receive, discuss and reinterpret content across publicly-accessible pages and posts. We’ll be starting with comments from public forums on Facebook, which researchers will be able to analyze within ICPSR’s virtual clean room.

Our Third Party Fact-Checking partners will also have access to Meta Content Library to help them investigate and debunk misinformation. We hope these powerful search capabilities will help them do this more efficiently, particularly during key moments such as elections.

To understand the impact social media apps like Facebook and Instagram have on the world, it’s important to support rigorous, independent research. That’s why Meta has been committed to an open and privacy-protective approach to research for many years, including making tools available to support public interest research, such as the US 2020 studies.

Over the past few months we gave Beta access to our new Meta Content Library and API tools. After multiple rounds of feedback with researchers and other stakeholders, we are now in a position to roll these tools out more broadly.

Meta Content Library & API

Our Meta Content Library and API tools provide access to near real-time public content from Pages, Posts, Groups and Events on Facebook, as well as from creator and business accounts on Instagram. Details about the content, such as the number of reactions, shares, comments and, for the first time, post view counts are also available. Researchers can search, explore and filter that content on both a graphical User Interface (UI) or through a programmatic API.

Together, these tools provide the most comprehensive access to publicly-available content across Facebook and Instagram of any research tool we have built to date. They also help us meet new regulatory requirements, data-sharing and transparency compliance obligations. Introducing these tools to researchers early in the development process gave us the opportunity to improve them before making them more widely available. We will continue to make improvements as we collect more feedback from researchers.

Individuals from qualified institutions pursuing scientific or public interest research topics will be able to apply for access to these tools through partners with deep expertise in secure data sharing for research, starting with the University of Michigan’s Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. This is a first-of-its-kind partnership that will enable researchers to analyze data from the API in ICPSR’s Social Media Archive’s (SOMAR) Virtual Data Enclave.

Social Capital Research

Last year, in collaboration with Raj Chetty and Harvard’s Opportunity Insights Program, we released a landmark study to measure the drivers of economic mobility in the US using information from 21 billion friendships on Facebook, which found that social connections play an important role in helping communities rise out of poverty.

We’re now expanding this research program with Harvard to better understand the drivers of economic mobility around the world by using insights from our platform on the dynamics of social networks, as well as publicly available data on socioeconomics and schools. We plan to examine cross-class friendships across the United Kingdom in collaboration with experts at the Behavioural Insights Team, Royal Society of Arts, Stripe Partners and Neighbourly Lab.

As well as expanding to more countries, we also plan to do more research into the role social connections play in economic opportunity including business creation, attending college, and getting a job. Building on our work looking at how social connections benefit people, we will continue to study how social networks help communities recover from crises and help displaced populations and migrants.","(meta, r&d participant, technology)

"Update on October 30, 2023 at 9:00AM PT:

We are expanding availability of Meta Verified for businesses on Instagram and Facebook to Australia and Canada.

Update on October 2, 2023 at 9:10AM PT:

We are beginning to test Meta Verified with businesses on Instagram and Facebook in New Zealand.

Originally published on September 19, 2023 at 10:45PM PT:

Earlier this year, we introduced Meta Verified for creators, a subscription bundle to help creators more easily establish their presence on Instagram and Facebook. Today at Meta’s Conversations Conference in Mumbai, Mark Zuckerberg announced we will soon expand Meta Verified to businesses on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp.

We’ll start with a test in the coming weeks for businesses on Instagram and Facebook in select countries – and will expand to businesses on WhatsApp in the future.

Meta Verified is built to help businesses more easily stand out on our apps and build confidence with their customers, including letting their customers know they’re chatting with the right business. Businesses can choose whether they’d like to subscribe for one subscription on a single app, or a bundled subscription across Instagram and Facebook, and in the future WhatsApp. With a monthly subscription, businesses will gain access to a toolkit for their subscribed Facebook page, Instagram professional account or WhatsApp phone number that includes:

A verified badge confirming your business is validated and authentic¹

Proactive impersonation monitoring for added brand protection

Access to support and help troubleshooting account issues²

New ways to be discovered: On Instagram and Facebook, subscribers will be featured as a Meta Verified business, including appearing at or near the top of search results and as a recommended verified business to follow in feed.³ WhatsApp business subscribers will receive additional premium features including the ability to create a custom WhatsApp page that is easily discoverable via a web search, and multi-device with chat assignment support so multiple employees can respond to customers.



A Meta Verified business subscription complements the existing free and paid tools available to businesses on our apps today. We’re starting with subscription features that help small businesses achieve what they want most on the platform: to establish their brand and be discovered by new customers. As we learn from initial testing, we’ll continue to evolve our business offerings to add more value for businesses of all sizes, such as more tools for people to easily discover and engage with verified businesses on our apps.

Meta Verified business subscriptions will be available for purchase on Instagram and Facebook in the coming weeks in select test countries. Monthly subscriptions start at $21.99 USD/month per Facebook page or Instagram account, or $34.99 USD/month for both.4 On WhatsApp, we’ll begin testing in the future with small businesses using the WhatsApp Business app before introducing Meta Verified to businesses on the WhatsApp Business Platform.5

Building safeguards from the start

Just as we did with our creator offering, Meta Verified for businesses is built with safeguards in mind from the start. We want businesses to feel confident their brands are protected on our apps, and people to feel confident the verified businesses they interact and message with are legitimate. As such, we’ve built a multi-step verification process and various checks into Meta Verified before, during, and after a business subscribes. For Instagram and Facebook subscriptions:

Businesses must meet eligibility requirements, including minimum tenure of Business Account and selected Facebook page / Instagram account, minimum page/account activity, and have 2Fac turned on.

Business information must be validated and applicants must verify their connection to the business with methods such as phone number, email or domain verification. 6

Subscriptions include proactive monitoring for business impersonation.

Learn more about Meta Verified for businesses here.

1. When you subscribe to Meta Verified on Instagram, the verified badge will also appear on Threads, if applicable. When you subscribe to Meta Verified on Facebook, the badge will also appear on Messenger, if applicable.

2. Subscribers who advertise with Meta already receive the Meta Verified Instagram and Facebook account support benefit.

3. All Meta Verified subscribers and their content must meet our Terms of Use and Community Guidelines. All content will be treated according to our existing guidelines for recommendations on Instagram or Facebook and our Content Guidelines. Subscribers will appear at or near the top of search results when a user query exactly matches a verified business name.

4. Subscriptions purchased on mobile are $27.99 a month per Facebook page or Instagram professional account. At this time, businesses purchasing on mobile are limited to 1 business asset subscription (Facebook page or Instagram pro account).

5. WhatsApp subscription pricing is not yet determined.

6. Once verified, businesses may not change business details such as name or profile picture. In the future, Meta Verified businesses that wish to change their business details will need to undergo verification review again.","(meta, parent-subsidiary, instagram)

"Today, we are announcing that in the UK, France and Germany we will deprecate Facebook News – a dedicated tab on Facebook in the bookmarks section that spotlights news – in early December.

This is part of an ongoing effort to better align our investments to our products and services people value the most. As a company, we have to focus our time and resources on things people tell us they want to see more of on the platform, including short form video. We know that people don’t come to Facebook for news and political content – they come to connect with people and discover new opportunities, passions and interests. News makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed, so news discovery is a small part of the Facebook experience for the vast majority of people.

The changes affecting the Facebook News feature will not otherwise impact Meta’s products and services in these countries. People will still be able to view links to news articles on Facebook. European news publishers will continue to have access to their Facebook accounts and Pages, where they can post links to their stories and direct people to their websites in the way any other individual or organization can. News organizations can also still leverage products like Reels and our ads system to reach broader audiences and drive people to their website, where they keep 100% of the revenue derived from outbound links on Facebook.

While we’ll be deprecating Facebook News in these countries, we will honour our obligations under all existing Facebook News deals with publishers in the UK, France and Germany until they expire. However, to ensure that we continue to invest in those products and services that drive user engagement, we will not enter into new commercial deals for news content on Facebook News in these countries and do not expect to offer new Facebook products specifically for news publishers in the future.

Our Commitment to Connecting People to Reliable Information

This does not impact our commitment to connecting people to reliable information on our platforms. We work with independent third-party fact-checkers – certified through the non-partisan International Fact-Checking Network – who review and rate viral misinformation on our apps. We have built the largest global fact-checking network of any platform by partnering with more than 90 independent fact-checking organisations around the world who review content in more than 60 languages. We have contributed more than $100 million to programs supporting our fact-checking efforts since 2016 to combat the spread of misinformation and we will continue to invest in this area.","(meta, owner, reels)

"We know that safety and security are top of mind for people using our apps, including businesses and advertisers. Today, as part of our quarterly integrity reporting, we’re sharing updates on our work to combat a range of threats, including covert influence operations, cyber espionage and malware campaigns.

In my first year as Meta’s chief information security officer, my focus has been bringing together teams working on integrity, security, support, and operations so that we can work together in the most effective way possible. Each of these efforts has been ongoing for many years, and a key focus for us has been sharing progress, bringing in outside experts and working with other companies to tackle industry-wide threats. It’s been more than 10 years since our bug bounty program began working with the security research community, 10 years since we first published transparency reports on government data requests, over five years since we started sharing takedowns of covert influence operations and five years since we published our first community standards enforcement report.

We’ve learned a lot through this work, including the importance of sharing both qualitative and quantitative insights into our integrity work. And it’s been encouraging to see our peers join us in expanding their trust and safety reporting. We’re committed to continuing these efforts, and today’s updates are good examples of this work.

Countering Malware Campaigns Across the Internet

My teams track and take action against hundreds of threat actors around the world, including malware campaigns. Here are a few things that stood out from our latest malware work.

First, our threat research has shown time and again that malware operators, just like spammers, are very attuned to what’s trendy at any given moment. They latch onto hot-button issues and popular topics to get people’s attention. The latest wave of malware campaigns have taken notice of generative AI technology that’s captured people’s imagination and excitement.

Since March alone, our security analysts have found around 10 malware families posing as ChatGPT and similar tools to compromise accounts across the internet. For example, we’ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-related tools. In fact, some of these malicious extensions did include working ChatGPT functionality alongside the malware. This was likely to avoid suspicion from the stores and from users. We’ve detected and blocked over 1,000 of these unique malicious URLs from being shared on our apps, and reported them to our industry peers at file-sharing services where malware was hosted so they, too, can take appropriate action.

This is not unique to the generative AI space. As an industry, we’ve seen this across other topics popular in their time, such as crypto scams fueled by the interest in digital currency. The generative AI space is rapidly evolving and bad actors know it, so we should all be vigilant.

Second, we’ve seen that our and industry’s efforts are forcing threat actors to rapidly evolve their tactics in attempts to evade detection and enable persistence. One way they do this is by spreading across as many platforms as they can to protect against enforcement by any one service. For example, we’ve seen malware families leveraging services like ours and LinkedIn, browsers like Chrome, Edge, Brave and Firefox, link shorteners, file-hosting services like Dropbox and Mega, and more. When they get caught, they mix in more services including smaller ones that help them disguise the ultimate destination of links. Another example is when some malware families masquerading as ChatGPT apps switched their lures to other popular themes like Google’s Bard or TikTok marketing support, in response to detection.

These changes are likely an attempt by threat actors to ensure that any one service has only limited visibility into the entire operation. When bad actors count on us to work in silos while they target people far and wide across the internet, we need to work together as an industry to protect people. That’s why we designed our threat research to help us scale our security work in a number of ways — it disrupts malicious operations on our platform and helps inform our industry’s defenses against threats that rarely target one platform. The insights we gain from this research help drive our continuous product development to protect people and businesses.

In the months and years ahead, we’ll continue to highlight how these malicious campaigns operate, share threat indicators with our industry peers and roll out new protections to address new tactics. For instance, we’re launching a new support flow for businesses impacted by malware. Read more about our work to help businesses stay safe on our apps.

Disrupting Cyber Espionage and Covert Influence Operations

In today’s Q1 Adversarial Threat report, we shared findings about nine adversarial networks we took action against for various security violations.

Six of these networks engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior (CIB) that originated in the US, Venezuela, Iran, China, Georgia, Burkina Faso and Togo, and primarily targeted people outside of their countries. We removed the majority of these networks before they were able to build authentic audiences.

Nearly all of them ran fictitious entities — news media organizations, hacktivist groups and NGOs — across the internet, including on Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, YouTube, Medium, TikTok, Blogspot, Reddit, WordPress, Freelancer[.]com, hacking forums and their own websites. Half of these operations were linked to private entities including an IT company in China, a US marketing firm and a political marketing consultancy in the Central African Republic.

We also disrupted three cyber espionage operations in South Asia, including an advanced persistent threat (APT) group we attributed to state-linked actors in Pakistan, a threat actor in India known in the security industry as Patchwork APT, and the threat group known as Bahamut APT in South Asia.

Each of these APTs relied heavily on social engineering to trick people into clicking on malicious links, downloading malware or sharing personal information across the internet. This investment in social engineering meant that these threat actors did not have to invest as much on the malware side. In fact, for at least two of these operations, we saw a reduction in the malicious capabilities in their apps, likely to ensure they can be published in official app stores. In response to the security community continuing to disrupt these malicious efforts, we’ve seen these APTs to be forced to set up new infrastructure, change tactics and invest more in hiding and diversifying their operations, which likely degraded their operations.

"Later this month, the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA), one of the most comprehensive pieces of internet regulation, will begin to fully apply to Facebook, Instagram and a number of other tech platforms and services. It is a big deal not just for European tech companies but for all tech companies that operate in the EU, and it will have a significant impact on the experiences Europeans have when they open their phones or fire up their laptops.

Meta has long advocated for a harmonised regulatory regime that effectively protects people’s rights online, while continuing to enable innovation. For this reason, we welcome the ambition for greater transparency, accountability and user empowerment that sits at the heart of regulations like the DSA, GDPR, and the ePrivacy Directive. The DSA in particular provides greater clarity on the roles and responsibilities of online platforms and it is right to seek to hold large platforms like ours to account through things like reporting and auditing, rather than attempting to micromanage individual pieces of content.

We’ve been working hard since the DSA came into force last November to respond to these new rules and adapt the existing safety and integrity systems and processes we have in place in many of the areas regulated by the DSA. We assembled one of the largest cross-functional teams in our history, with over 1,000 people currently working on the DSA, to develop solutions to the DSA’s requirements. These include measures to increase transparency about how our systems work, and to give people more options to tailor their experiences on Facebook and Instagram. We have also established a new, independent compliance function to help us meet our regulatory obligations on an ongoing basis.

Building on Our Industry-leading Ads Transparency and Protections

We were the first platform to put in place ads transparency tools and, for many years, we’ve provided industry-leading transparency for social issue, electoral and political ads. We are now building on that by expanding our Ad Library to display and archive all ads that target people in the EU, along with dates the ad ran, the parameters used for targeting (e.g., age, gender, location), who was served the ad, and more. These ads will be stored in our public Ad Library for a year, so anyone, anywhere, can better understand every ad that’s run in the EU.

As part of our continued work to keep our apps age-appropriate for teens, we’ve also made changes to their ads experience on our platforms. Since February, teens aged 13-17 globally no longer see advertising based on their activity on our apps — like following certain Instagram posts or Facebook pages. Age and location is now the only information about teens that advertisers can use to show them ads.

Giving People More Information About How Our Platforms Work

We’re providing an unprecedented level of insight into how our AI systems rank content by releasing 22 system cards for Facebook and Instagram. These cards provide information about how our AI systems rank content for Feed, Reels, Stories, and other surfaces; some of the predictions each system makes to determine what content might be most relevant to people; and the options available to help customise an experience on Facebook and Instagram. These build on our long-standing “Why Am I Seeing This” feature, which allows people to see details directly in our apps about why our systems predicted that specific content would be relevant to them, and the types of activity and inputs that may have led to that prediction.

We’re also rolling out two new tools for researchers – the Meta Content Library and API. The library includes publicly available content from Pages, Posts, Groups and Events on Facebook, as well as publicly available content from creator and business accounts on Instagram. Researchers will be able to search, explore, and filter the publicly available content on a graphical User Interface (UI) or through a programmatic API. These tools will provide the most comprehensive access to publicly-available content across Facebook and Instagram of any research tool we have built to date.

Giving People More Control Over Their Experiences on Facebook and Instagram

As well as additional transparency, we’re also providing people with more options to help tailor what they see on Facebook and Instagram. I’ve written previously about our AI ranking and recommendation processes, which help you see content we think you’ll find most meaningful and reduce the distribution of problematic content, so you’re less likely to come across it. We’re now giving our European community the option to view and discover content on Reels, Stories, Search and other parts of Facebook and Instagram that is not ranked by Meta using these systems. For example, on Facebook and Instagram, users will have the option to view Stories and Reels only from people they follow, ranked in chronological order, newest to oldest. They will also be able to view Search results based only on the words they enter, rather than personalised specifically to them based on their previous activity and personal interests.

For a number of years, in addition to reporting options for content that might violate our Community Standards and Guidelines, we’ve also had dedicated reporting tools for illegal content. We’ve now made those tools even easier for people to access. And while we already notify people when we remove a piece of their content, and typically give them the chance to appeal, we’ll now provide this information to people in the EU for a broader range of content moderation decisions. This includes when we apply feature limits to people’s accounts and when we restrict content for violating local law.

The Future of Harmonised Regulation

From early on, we’ve been supportive of the objectives of the DSA and the creation of a regulatory regime in Europe that minimises harm effectively, protects and empowers people, and upholds their fundamental rights. The hard work of creating these pioneering new rules has come to an end, and the process of implementing them has begun. In this new regulatory environment, it is critical that the DSA now maintains its primacy over existing and new national laws, to protect the clarity it has created for services, maintain consistency in the way tech companies are held to account, and preserve the harmonious way people experience our platforms across the region. A strong and open digital single market is of vital importance to the competitiveness of Europe as a whole, and we will continue to work closely with European policymakers and regulators in support of this shared vision.","(european tech companies, emerging entrant, meta)

"One billion avatars. Yesterday, we got to publicly announce and celebrate that incredible milestone. More than one billion avatars have been created across our technologies. That’s a billion times people have reimagined how they show up online — like showing up to meetings in a suit and tie while wearing pajamas in real life. Respect.

Today, we’re announcing some improvements to Meta Avatars that will help freshen up your look just in time for spring. We’re adding a handful of new avatar body shapes to help you better express yourself — especially if expressing yourself means dancing along to “Hips Don’t Lie.” We’ve also partnered with PUMA to bring seven outfits to the Meta Avatars Store.

And we’re continuing to make your avatar look better in smaller and subtler ways as well, because those details help your personality shine through. Literally shine, as we’re adding a bit more sparkle to your eyes, brushing some volume into your hair and making clothes look more realistic and textured. You’ll see these changes when you use your avatar outside of virtual reality (VR).

Introducing New Body Shapes

Everybody’s different, and every body’s different. Until now, though, the body shape options available when creating your avatar were all pretty similar. Maybe a little rectangular.

We created them as a good jumping-off point when we launched this iteration of avatars back in 2021. But, we’ve heard feedback that not all of you can see yourselves in the current options.

So we’re adding more choices, simple as that. Starting this month, you’ll be able to choose from a wider range of body shape options, including two curvier body shapes. We’re refining some of our existing options to help differentiate them as well.

Self-expression and representation matter — it’s what makes your avatar feel like you — and we’ll continue adding more options over time, working toward a future where everyone can create an avatar they love.

New PUMA Looks

Last year we introduced the Avatars Store, a one-stop shop for customizing your avatar across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and in VR. Since launch, we’ve brought in outfits from some of the world’s leading fashion, sports, and lifestyle brands — including Madhappy, the NBA, Prada and Thom Browne.

Add PUMA to the list. We’ve partnered with the sports brand to offer seven of its lifestyle looks starting May 1.

Hair and Clothing Textures

Lastly, we’ve overhauled how your avatar’s hair, clothing and eyes appear in stickers, profile pictures, cover photos and more.

Sparing you the nitty-gritty technical breakdown, we’ve added additional detail and realism to both hair and clothing — meaning whether you’re rocking a clean fade and suit or bedhead and sweats, your avatar should pop a little better than before. Solid glow-up, right? We’ve also tweaked our lighting model to add a little more of a reflective gleam to your eyes, making them sparkle and bring your personality to life.

Keep an eye out for more changes. We have a lot of improvements coming to avatars this year, and we can’t wait to share more!

As a reminder, when you create an avatar and share it across our technologies it will be public to other people. Learn more about controlling your avatar permissions.","(meta, partnership, puma)

"Today, as prompted by feedback from the Oversight Board’s continued push to ensure our penalty system is more proportionate, we’re taking steps to update Facebook’s penalty system to make it more effective and fair. Since nothing is changing about the underlying content removal, we do not anticipate this penalty system refinement to have a material effect on prevalence. With this update we will still be able to keep our app safe while also allowing people to express themselves.

Under the new system, we will focus on helping people understand why we have removed their content, which is shown to be more effective at preventing re-offending, rather than so quickly restricting their ability to post. We will still apply account restrictions to persistent violators, typically beginning at the seventh violation, after we’ve given sufficient warnings and explanations to help the person understand why we removed their content. We will also restrict people from posting in groups at lower thresholds where warranted. For more serious violations: posting content that includes terrorism, child exploitation, human trafficking, suicide promotion, sexual exploitation, the sale of non-medical drugs or the promotion of dangerous individuals and organizations, we will continue to apply immediate consequences, including account removal in severe cases.

The vast majority of people on our apps are well-intentioned. Historically, some of those people have ended up in “Facebook jail” without understanding what they did wrong or whether they were impacted by a content enforcement mistake.

Our analysis has found that nearly 80% of users with a low number of strikes do not go on to violate our policies again in the next 60 days. This means that most people respond well to a warning and explanation since they don’t want to violate our policies. But at the same time, some people are determined to post violating content regardless of our policies. Our analysis suggests that applying more severe penalties at the seventh strike is a more effective way to give well-intentioned people the guidance they need while still removing bad actors.

As well as being more effective, these changes will be fairer to those people who may have been disproportionately impacted by our old system, particularly when we made an incorrect moderation decision or missed context. For example, someone may jokingly post, “I’m on my way to kidnap you,” not knowing that this statement could violate our violence and incitement policy, when really it was a post about taking a friend out for dinner after that person had a rough day. Someone else might post a friend’s name and address as a way of sharing information for a party, and without that context, that post might appear to be sharing personally identifiable information in violation of our policies. The implications of overenforcement are real — when people are unintentionally caught up in this system, they may find it hard to run their business, connect with their communities or express themselves.

Our previous system resorted quickly to long penalties, such as a 30-day block on a person’s ability to create content. These long blocks were frustrating for well-intentioned people who had made mistakes, and they did little to help those people understand our policies. The blocks also made it harder for us to spot violation trends and sometimes had the effect of letting bad actors stay on the site longer. Our new system, which reduces the number of restriction periods, will allow us to detect persistent violators in less time, leading to faster and more impactful actions.

Today’s changes, while based on our own analysis and feedback of the Oversight Board, are also responsive to feedback from our community — including our civil rights auditors — who noted that our current enforcement system needs more focus on proportionality. Independent experts who offered their guidance on this topic have routinely noted that our penalty system should have a better balance between punishing and encouraging remediation through education.

“…It is positive that Meta has introduced further transparency and coherence in this area as a result of implementing prior Oversight Board recommendations, moving towards what should be a more proportionate and transparent approach with higher strike-to-penalty thresholds. Meta’s plans to issue more comprehensive penalty notifications should ensure that users are better placed to understand the reasons for the consequences of strikes and the reasons for feature-limits in the future.” – Oversight Board Iran protest slogan Case Decision

External guidance is an important part of this process, and we’ll continue to work with experts in academia, civil society and the policy community to continue to improve and evolve our policy enforcement in an ever changing environment. We will provide more updates as this process continues.","(meta, r&d participant, oversight board)

"Today I’m delighted to announce that we are rolling out default end-to-end encryption for personal messages and calls on Messenger and Facebook, as well as a suite of new features that let you further control your messaging experience. We take our responsibility to protect your messages seriously and we’re thrilled that after years of investment and testing, we’re able to launch a safer, more secure and private service.

Since 2016, Messenger has had the option for people to turn on end-to-end encryption, but we’re now changing private chats and calls across Messenger to be end-to-end encrypted by default. This has taken years to deliver because we’ve taken our time to get this right. Our engineers, cryptographers, designers, policy experts and product managers have worked tirelessly to rebuild Messenger features from the ground up. We’ve introduced new privacy, safety and control features along the way like delivery controls that let people choose who can message them, as well as app lock, alongside existing safety features like report, block and message requests. We worked closely with outside experts, academics, advocates and governments to identify risks and build mitigations to ensure that privacy and safety go hand-in-hand.

The extra layer of security provided by end-to-end encryption means that the content of your messages and calls with friends and family are protected from the moment they leave your device to the moment they reach the receiver’s device. This means that nobody, including Meta, can see what’s sent or said, unless you choose to report a message to us.

End-to-end encryption gives people more secure chats in Messenger. These chats will not only have all of the things people know and love, like themes and custom reactions, but also a host of new features we know are important for our community. These new features will be available for use immediately, though it may take some time for Messenger chats to be updated with default end-to-end encryption.

Edit a Message

You can now edit messages that may have been sent too soon, or that you’d simply like to change, for up to 15 minutes after you send them. You can still report abuse in an edited message and Meta will be able to see the previous versions of the edited message.

Disappearing Messages

Disappearing messages on Messenger now last for 24 hours after being sent. We are also improving the interface to make it easier to tell when disappearing messages are turned on. This will help people be confident that their messages stay secure and won’t stick around forever. Disappearing messages on Messenger are only available for end-to-end encrypted conversations, but you can still report disappearing messages if you receive something inappropriate, and we’ll notify you if we detect that someone screenshots a disappearing message.

Read Receipts Control

Our new read receipt control allows you to decide if you want others to see when you have read their messages. We know people value their privacy, and this feature gives you the ability to feel less pressure to respond immediately.

Photo and Video Upgrades

People share over 1.3 billion photos and videos per day on Messenger. We’ve now made photos and videos easier to access, upgraded the image quality, added fun layouts and introduced more controls so you can reply or react to any photo or video in a collection. We’re going to continue rolling out improvements over the coming months — we’re currently testing HD media and file sharing improvements with a small group of users and plan to scale them in the coming months.

Voice Messaging

Voice messaging is the fastest growing messaging format today. You can now play voice messages at 1.5x or 2x speeds, pick up listening to a voice message from where you left off, and continue listening to a voice message when you navigate away from the chat or the app.



Security Engineering

We want to be open about the security technology we use and welcome the chance to engage with external cryptographers and security experts. That’s why we are also publishing two papers which outline our approach to cryptography, as well as how we encrypt your message history with Secure Storage. Because there are over a billion Messenger users, not everyone will get default end-to-end encryption right away. It will take a number of months to complete the global roll-out. When your chats are upgraded, you will be prompted to set up a recovery method, such as a PIN, so you can restore your messages if you lose, change or add a device.

This is the biggest set of improvements to Messenger since it was first launched in 2011. I’m proud of what Messenger has become: a fast and reliable service, with enjoyable features and strong safety tools, and now with the added privacy and security of end-to-end encryption.","(meta, designer/developer, default end-to-end encryption)

"Billions of people use Facebook and Instagram every day to share the ups and downs of life, to connect with people who share their interests, and to discover content they enjoy. To make everyone’s experience on our apps unique and personalized to them, we use AI systems to decide what content appears, informed by the choices they make.

I wrote previously about the relationship between you and the algorithms Meta uses to shape what you see on Facebook and Instagram, and to challenge the myth that algorithms leave people powerless over the content they see. In that piece, I wrote that we needed to be more frank about how this relationship works and to give you more control over what you see.

Today, we’re building on that commitment by being more transparent around several of the AI systems that incorporate your feedback to rank content across Facebook and Instagram. These systems make it more likely that the posts you see are relevant and interesting to you. We’re also making it clearer how you can better control what you see on our apps, as well as testing new controls and making others more accessible. And we’re giving more detailed information for experts so they can better understand and analyze our systems.

This is part of a wider ethos of openness, transparency and accountability. With rapid advances taking place with powerful technologies like generative AI, it’s understandable that people are both excited by the possibilities and concerned about the risks. We believe that the best way to respond to those concerns is with openness. Generally speaking, we believe that as these technologies are developed, companies should be more open about how their systems work and collaborate openly across industry, government and civil society to help ensure they are developed responsibly. That starts with giving you more insight into, and control over, the content you see.

How AI Predictions Influence Recommendations

Our AI systems predict how valuable a piece of content might be to you, so we can show it to you sooner. For example, sharing a post is often an indicator that you found that post to be interesting, so predicting that you will share a post is one factor our systems take into account. As you might imagine, no single prediction is a perfect gauge of whether a post is valuable to you. So we use a wide variety of predictions in combination to get as close as possible to the right content, including some based on behavior and some based on user feedback received through surveys.

We want to be more open about how this works. A model of transparency Meta has been developing and advocating for some time is the publication of system cards, which give people insight into how our systems work in a way that is accessible for those who don’t have deep technical knowledge. Today, we are releasing 22 system cards for Facebook and Instagram. They give information about how our AI systems rank content, some of the predictions each system makes to determine what content might be most relevant to you, as well as the controls you can use to help customize your experience. They cover Feed, Stories, Reels and other surfaces where people go to find content from the accounts or people they follow. The system cards also cover AI systems that recommend “unconnected” content from people, groups, or accounts they don’t follow. You can find a more detailed explanation of the AI behind content recommendations here.

To give a further level of detail beyond what’s published in the system cards, we’re sharing the types of inputs – known as signals – as well as the predictive models these signals inform that help determine what content you will find most relevant from your network on Facebook. The categories of signals we’re releasing represent the vast majority of signals currently used in Facebook Feed ranking for this content. You can find these signals and predictions in the Transparency Center, along with how frequently they tend to be used in the overall ranking process.

We also use signals to help identify harmful content, which we remove as we become aware of it, as well as to help reduce the distribution of other types of problematic or low-quality content in line with our Content Distribution Guidelines. We’re including some examples of the signals we use to do this. But there’s a limit to what we can disclose safely. While we want to be transparent about how we try to keep bad content away from people’s Feeds, we also need to be careful not to disclose signals which might make it easier for people to circumvent our defenses.

Of course, not everyone will find information just because we publish it on our website. That’s why we make it possible to see details directly in our apps about why our systems predicted content would be relevant to you, and the types of activity and inputs that may have led to that prediction. We’re expanding our “Why Am I Seeing This?” feature in Instagram Reels tab and Explore, and Facebook Reels in the coming weeks, after previously launching it for some Feed content and all ads on both Facebook and Instagram. You’ll be able to click on an individual reel to see more information about how your previous activity may have informed the machine learning models that shape and deliver the reels you see.

Expanding Tools to Personalize Your Experience

By using the tools available, you have the ability to shape your experiences on our apps so you see more of the content you want to see, and less of the content you don’t. To make this easier, we’ve created centralized places on Facebook and Instagram where you can customize controls that influence the content you see on each app. You can visit your Feed Preferences on Facebook and the Suggested Content Control Center on Instagram through the three-dot menu on relevant posts, as well as through Settings.

On Instagram, we’re testing a new feature that makes it possible for you to indicate that you’re “Interested” in a recommended reel in the Reels tab, so we can show you more of what you like. The “Not Interested” feature has been available since 2021. You can learn more about influencing what you see across Instagram here.

So you can customize your experience and the content you see, we also have a “Show more, Show less” feature on Facebook, which is available on all posts in Feed, Video, and Reels via the three-dot-menu. We’re working on ways to make the feature even more prominent. And if you don’t want an algorithmically-ranked Feed – or just want to see what your Feed would look like without it – you can use the Feeds tab on Facebook or select Following on Instagram to switch to a chronological Feed. You can also add people to your Favorites list on both Facebook and Instagram so you can always see content from your favorite accounts.

Providing Better Tools for Researchers

We also believe an open approach to research and innovation – especially when it comes to transformative AI technologies – is better than leaving the know-how in the hands of a small number of big tech companies. That’s why we’ve released over 1,000 AI models, libraries and data sets for researchers over the last decade so they can benefit from our computing power and pursue research openly and safely. It is our ambition to continue to be transparent as we make more AI models openly available in future.

In the next few weeks, we will start rolling out a new suite of tools for researchers: Meta Content Library and API. The Library includes data from public posts, pages, groups, and events on Facebook. For Instagram, it will include public posts and data from creator and business accounts. Data from the Library can be searched, explored, and filtered on a graphical user interface or through a programmatic API. Researchers from qualified academic and research institutions pursuing scientific or public interest research topics will be able to apply for access to these tools through partners with deep expertise in secure data sharing for research, starting with the University of Michigan’s Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. These tools will provide the most comprehensive access to publicly-available content across Facebook and Instagram of any research tool we have built to date and also help us meet new data-sharing and transparency compliance obligations.

We hope by introducing these products to researchers early in the development process, we can receive constructive feedback to ensure we’re building the best possible tools to meet their needs.","(meta, parent-subsidiary, facebook)

"Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of its work force, the latest move to hew to what the company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a “year of efficiency.”

The layoffs will affect Meta’s recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company’s website. The announcement is the company’s second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13 percent of its work force at the time.

Meta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Mr. Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta’s hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing last March.

“This will be tough and there’s no way around that,” he wrote.

"Mark Zuckerberg has spent the last nine months against the ropes as his company has made big cuts to its work force and struggled to gain mainstream traction with its ambitious plans for virtual reality.

On Thursday, he told Meta employees how he planned to get the company back on track. In an all-hands meeting, Mr. Zuckerberg offered an explanation for recent layoffs and for the first time laid out a vision for how Meta’s work in artificial intelligence would blend with its plans for the virtual reality it calls the metaverse.

Mr. Zuckerberg’s talk was an attempt to rally staff after the most tumultuous period in his company’s 19-year history. The chief executive said he made “tough decisions” about layoffs with the goal of “building a better technology company” that shipped better products, faster — something he believed Meta wasn’t doing well as it swelled to more than 80,000 employees at the peak of the pandemic.

“I want us to use this period that’s going to be a bit more stable in order to evolve and rebuild our culture,” he said, according to two people who attended the meeting and shared remarks and a recording with The New York Times.","(meta, product manufacturer, technology)","{""SECTOR"": [""Technology""], ""COMPANY"": [""Meta"", """"]}","{""title"": ""After a Rocky Year, Zuckerberg Lays Out Meta’s Road Map to Employees"", ""publisher"": ""The New York Times"", ""authors"": ""Mike Isaac"", ""published_date"": ""2023-06-08""}"
"There’s nothing quite like the call of the open road. Whether it’s quality conversation on an epic road trip, enjoying a podcast or your favorite album, just about everyone has some fond memories in cars. But what if we could make our time spent in cars more productive, social and entertaining than ever before?

That question is at the heart of Meta’s partnership with BMW. Announced in 2021, the goal of this joint research project is to explore how augmented and virtual reality (AR and VR) could one day be integrated into smart vehicles to enhance the passenger experience.

If we get it right, this technology could revolutionize travel in cars, trains, planes and beyond, unlocking new forms of hands-free communication, entertainment and utility — giving us far more value than the screens and instruments we’re used to seeing in vehicles today.

Oculus Insight vs. the Open Road

VR headsets are equipped with a number of sensors but moving vehicles pose a tricky challenge, because tracking technology like Oculus Insight use both inertial motion sensors (IMUs) and cameras to precisely estimate the headset’s location and motion.

In a moving environment — more precisely, in a non-inertial reference frame — these two modalities are in conflict as the cameras observe motion relative to the inside of the car, while the IMUs measure acceleration and rotational velocity relative to the world. That mismatch means a VR headset like Meta Quest 2 can’t currently display stable virtual content when traveling inside a vehicle as it turns and/or accelerates.

At least, that is, until now.

Challenge Accepted

To solve this problem, we collaborated with BMW to incorporate IMU data from a BMW car’s sensor array in real time into the tracking system of our Project Aria research glasses. This additional information allows the system to calculate the glasses’ location relative to the car.

That was a huge feat because after transferring the tracking system to a Meta Quest Pro, it allowed us to accurately anchor virtual objects to a moving car using a digital twin of the car. We’ve been able to demo some compelling virtual and mixed reality passenger experiences in moving cars using this new tracking system and Meta Quest Pro. The next step will be to add the car’s location relative to the world, which would enable world-locked rendering.

Going forward, we hope to continue working with BMW to further leverage the growing machine perception capabilities of modern cars to enable future use cases. Access to the car’s precise 6DOF positioning system could allow us to render world-locked virtual content outside of the vehicle, like identifying landmarks and other points of interest. We expect this capability to be invaluable for future AR glasses and personalized AI assistants.

It’s an exciting vision, and it’s a road we’re committed to traveling.","(meta, r&d participant, technology)

"Update on August 22, 2023 at 9:00AM PT:

Starting today, millions more people’s chats on Messenger will be upgraded to stronger encryption standards as part of our ongoing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) testing. We remain on track to launch default E2EE for one-to-one friends and family chats on Messenger by the end of the year. As we expand the testing, we’re also sharing an update on how we’re approaching this massive engineering challenge.

Originally published on January 23, 2023 at 7:05AM PT:

Today Mark Zuckerberg announced the introduction of some of the features that you love in Messenger to end-to-end encrypted chats, including:

Chat themes: We’ve added chat themes to help personalize and enhance your conversations in end-to-end encrypted chats. Tired of a plain background? Can’t wait to show your Swiftie credentials with the Midnights theme? Now you can set themes, including static color and gradient themes, for end-to-end encrypted chats.

Custom chat emojis and reactions: Want to personalize your response? You can see the full menu of emoji reactions and customize the quick reaction tray in end-to-end encrypted chats.

Group profile photos: Choose group profile photos for different chats with friends or work colleagues.

Link previews: We’ve rebuilt link previews for end-to-end encrypted chats so that you can see where a link is taking you, before clicking on it.

Active Status: Let people see when you’re active, so they know when it’s a good time to call. You can also choose to turn this feature off, if you want to improve your privacy.

Bubbles on Android: Bubbles (a circle with your friend’s picture) let you read and reply to messages while you’re using other apps. Once enabled, a bubble will appear when you get a new message.

We’ve also started gradually expanding testing default end-to-end encryption for Messenger. We know people want a space to connect and they want to know that those conversations are private, safe and secure. That is why we’ve spent time building a team of talented engineers, cryptologists, designers and policy experts who are all committed to rolling out default end-to-end encryption on Messenger.

Over the next few months, more people will continue to see some of their chats gradually being upgraded with an extra layer of protection provided by end-to-end encryption. We will notify people in these individual chat threads as they are upgraded. We know people will have questions about how we select and upgrade individual threads, so we wanted to make clear that this is a random process. It’s designed to be random so that there isn’t a negative impact on our infrastructure and people’s chat experience. This also ensures our new end-to-end encrypted threads continue to give people the fast, reliable and rich experience on Messenger.

Building a secure and resilient end-to-end encrypted service for the billions of messages that are sent on Messenger every day requires careful testing. We’ll provide updates as we continue to make progress towards this goal over the course of 2023.","(facebook, owner, messenger)

"As social media platforms have empowered people to connect with others, express themselves freely, and build and be part of borderless communities, online political debate has erupted. Platforms like Facebook and Instagram have become a stage for democratic debate – between citizens, between candidates and voters, and for campaigners and advocacy groups. Much of that is positive – if raucous, messy, and often intense.

But with these technologies being so young, and their emergence taking place during a period of profound economic, political and wider technological disruption, our understanding of social media’s role in society is still imperfect and incomplete. We are faced with a number of important questions to which there are still no definitive answers based on clear empirical evidence. Does social media make us more polarized as a society or merely reflect divisions that already exist? Does it help people become better informed about politics, or less? How does it affect people’s attitudes toward government and democracy?

Today we have new evidence to help answer some of these questions. Ahead of the US Presidential election in 2020, there was an opportunity to create an evidence base for researchers to dive into these and other questions, as well as strong demand from academics to do the research. That was the impetus behind an unprecedented research partnership between Meta and external academics to better understand the impact of Facebook and Instagram on key political attitudes and behaviors during that election cycle. The result is a series of studies, the first four of which are published today. The intention is for more papers – 16 in total – to be published in the future.

The papers published today include studies of the effects of algorithmic ranking and virality, the prevalence and effects of like-minded information exposure on Facebook, and ideological segregation in exposure to news. Although questions about social media’s impact on key political attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors are not fully settled, the experimental findings add to a growing body of research showing there is little evidence that key features of Meta’s platforms alone cause harmful ‘affective’ polarization or have meaningful effects on these outcomes. They also challenge the now commonplace assertion that the ability to reshare content on social media drives polarization.

For example, Nature’s summary of one paper states that the findings “challenge views about the extent to which the ‘echo chambers’ of social media drive political polarization.” And the co-chairs of the study have stated: “Removing reshared content on Facebook produced a decrease in news knowledge among the study participants, and did not significantly affect political polarization or other individual-level political attitudes.”

The studies also shed new light on the claim that the way content is surfaced on social media — and by Meta’s algorithms specifically — keeps people divided. One of the papers shows there is considerable ideological segregation in consumption of political news, reflecting a complex interaction between algorithmic and social factors. Yet, when participants in the experiments saw a reduced amount of content from sources that reinforced their views, they were actually more likely to engage with the like-minded content they did see. And even then, it had no detectable impact on polarization, political attitudes or beliefs.

Michael Wagner, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, has observed the research process throughout to document and publicly comment on the research process as an independent observer. And as Dr. Wagner writes in his introduction to the papers, changes to what participants saw in their feeds or whether they encountered reshared content “did not reduce polarization or improve political knowledge during the 2020 US election. Indeed, removing reshared content reduced political knowledge.”

We will continue to review these papers in full, as well as those we expect to be published in the coming months.

This is the first time Meta, or any technology company, has entered into such a partnership to transparently study its impact on elections. The external researchers have had full operational and intellectual independence throughout. They were not paid by Meta and they don’t answer to us either. We’ve signed the same contracts with them that we do with other independent researchers who use our data, which is publicly posted on Social Science One’s web site.

The US 2020 project is a partnership between Meta researchers and external academics, the latter led by Professor Talia Jomini Stroud, founder and current Director of the Center for Media Engagement at the University of Texas at Austin, and Professor Joshua A. Tucker, co-director of the Center for Social Media and Politics at New York University. Professors Stroud and Tucker selected 15 additional researchers to collaborate on this effort, based on their expertise. Meta’s internal researchers designed the studies together with these external partners. Importantly, neither Meta’s researchers nor the company as a whole have the authority to restrict their findings – regardless of whether they are favorable or not for the company.

As four of the lead researchers explained in a blog when the project was announced, it hoped to get over two major hurdles that have stood in the way of previous research into these issues. Firstly, that “increasing public concern and legal obligations related to data privacy led social media companies to restrict access to data previously used by external researchers.” And secondly, that “it is hard to conduct a rigorous scientific study on social media’s impact after the fact.”

To overcome these issues, data was collected during the election cycle – not after – and we asked for explicit, informed consent from those who opted to be part of the research that analyzes individual level data. This means research participants consented to both the use of their data and that they were provided information on how and why their data would be used. Additionally, as part of the studies, the researchers also analyzed aggregated user data on Facebook and Instagram to help understand patterns. The studies – and consent language – were also reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) to ensure they adhered to high ethical standards.

The findings were submitted to academic journals in open access format, which means they will be freely available to the public. Meta and the researchers have also documented study plans and hypotheses in advance through a pre-registration process and those initial commitments are being released upon publication of the studies. This means that people will be able to check that we did what we said we would – and didn’t hide any of the results. In addition, to run their own analyses and further check our homework, we plan to deliver de-identified data (i.e. data that cannot be reasonably linked to an individual) on the studies we run. This foundational data will be archived by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), part of the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, where it is available for other researchers to run their own analysis and check the validity of the findings.

Last year, Meta’s transparency products were used to further academic research on elections, polarization, digital violence, misinformation, and other pressing social issues in dozens of publications. We recently announced that researchers can apply for access to beta versions of a new suite of research tools: Meta Content Library and API. The Library includes data from public posts, pages, groups, and events on Facebook. For Instagram, it will include public posts and data from creator and business accounts. Data from the Library can be searched, explored, and filtered on a graphical user interface or through a programmatic API.

The research published in these papers won’t settle every debate about social media and democracy, but we hope and expect it will advance society’s understanding of these issues. Its findings will be hugely valuable to us, and we hope they will also help policymakers as they shape the rules of the road for the internet – for the benefit of our democracy, and society as a whole.","(technology, r&d participant, meta)

"Today, as part of our quarterly threat reporting, we’re sharing updates on how our security, integrity and support teams help protect businesses against malware — one of the most prevalent threats across the internet. This includes a behind-the-scenes look at how we tackle this challenge from multiple angles at once: malware analysis and threat disruption, product updates, community support and education, information sharing with other companies and holding threat actors accountable.

Last year, we shared our insights into malicious mobile apps that indiscriminately target the general public and were available in official app stores. Today, we’re publishing detailed findings into aggressive and persistent strains of malware targeting business accounts online.

Because these malicious groups are financially motivated, we expect them to continue probing defenses by diversifying their operations to spread across the internet so they can withstand disruptions by any one company — ours included. That’s why we’re sharing our findings, tips and threat indicators so that the defender community and people using our services can take steps to stay safe.

What We’ve Found

Our security researchers track and take action against hundreds of threat actors around the world. This year alone, we’ve detected and disrupted nearly ten new malware strains, including those posing as ChatGPT browser extensions and productivity tools, the latest iterations of malware known in the security community as Ducktail, and previously unreported malware families including one we call NodeStealer.

These malware families target people through email phishing, malicious browser extensions, ads and mobile apps, and various social media platforms with an aim to run unauthorized ads from the compromised business accounts across the internet.

We’ve identified these malware operations at different stages of their lifecycle and have already seen rapid adversarial adaptation in response to our detection, including some of them choosing to shift their initial targeting elsewhere on the internet.

As part of our most recent work to protect people and businesses from malicious targeting using ChatGPT as a lure, since March 2023 we’ve blocked and shared with our industry peers more than 1,000 malicious links from being shared across our technologies and reported a number of browser extensions and mobile apps to our peer companies. With each threat investigation, we’ve continued to strengthen how we detect and block these types of malware threats at scale.

As part of our work against Ducktail malware, we also issued a cease and desist letter to individuals behind it in Vietnam, referred to law enforcement, and will consider all appropriate additional enforcement options against malicious actors behind targeting people on our services.

How Does Business-Targeting Malware Work?

Threat actors go through many stages to target businesses with malware — from developing or acquiring malicious software, to hosting it somewhere online, to spreading and delivering it to targets, and hiding it to evade detection by companies like ours. This complexity makes the threat of business-targeting malware an ecosystem challenge, requiring a concerted effort to combat these malicious operations across our entire industry.

While attack scenarios may vary, threat actors typically disguise malware within innocuous-looking files, as well as mobile apps or browser extensions available in official app stores. Like spammers, they latch onto popular topics like political news or the latest tech or business productivity tools to hide their malware and trick people into clicking on or downloading it.

For example, one of the campaigns we recently disrupted leveraged people’s interest in Open AI’s ChatGPT to lure them into installing malware. In response to detection by our security teams and also our industry peers, we’ve seen bad actors quickly pivot to other themes, including posing as Google Bard, TikTok marketing tools, pirated software and movies, and Windows utilities.

To target businesses, malicious groups often first go after the personal accounts of people who manage or are connected to business pages and advertising accounts. Threat actors may design their malware to target a particular online platform, including building in more sophisticated forms of account compromise than what you’d typically expect from run-of-the-mill malware.

For example, we’ve seen malware families that can attempt to evade two-factor authentication or have the ability to automatically scan for and detect connections between the compromised account and business accounts it might be linked to. See more details in our technical threat research.

Product and Support Updates

To help businesses stay safe across their Meta accounts, we’re continuing to roll out protections against malicious activity:

New malware removal support: Malware can be designed to re-compromise accounts even after they’ve been recovered by their rightful owners. This leads to a continuous cycle of compromise and recovery that can only be fully resolved when the malware is removed by the user. To help businesses that may have unknowingly self-compromised their devices, we’re launching a new support tool that guides people step-by-step through how to identify and remove malware, including using third-party antivirus tools. Because compromise often occurs outside of our apps and technologies, these stand-alone tools are a critical step in the recovery cycle to help business accounts stay safe.

Verifying connected Business Manager accounts: We often see threat actors attempt to use compromised accounts to add themselves as business admins to connected business Pages. To help protect against this, we’ve rolled out an ability for businesses to have more visibility and control over administrator changes in Business Manager. For example, businesses can now create restrictions to only allow admins from trusted, selected domains and more effectively audit people’s access through a new active or inactive status filter to assess the status of admins.

Increasing protections for sensitive account actions: We are expanding authorization requirements for sensitive business account actions like accessing a credit line or changing business administrators. To complete the change, businesses will be prompted to authenticate with two-factor authentication, email verification or co-worker approval. They can also select a trusted employee that is not an administrator to approve sensitive actions.

Introducing Meta Work accounts: Later this year, we will begin rolling out Meta Work accounts to allow business users to log in and operate Business Manager without requiring a personal account. This will help keep business accounts more secure in cases when attackers begin with a personal account compromise. We plan to test work accounts with a limited set of advertisers this year and aim to expand availability over time. Once work accounts become available, organizations can manage them on behalf of their employees and have access to administrative features including single sign-on, automated account provisioning and more.

How to Know If Your Device is Affected

If you identify unusual behavior on your device or online accounts, it might be a sign that you may have inadvertently downloaded malware. Here are some telltale signs to look out for:

Suspicious activity on your online accounts that you did not authorize, including financial charges

Your device runs significantly slower or is frequently freezing

New toolbars, icons or tabs appear in your browser that you don’t recognize

Scammy pop-ups appear in your browser

Shorter device battery life

What to Do If Your Device is Affected

If you believe you’ve downloaded malicious software, we recommend that you delete it from your device immediately, scan your device with up-to-date antivirus software and follow these instructions to secure your personal and business accounts:","(meta, collaborators, businesses)

"Mark Zuckerberg has started delivering on his promise to make 2023 a “year of efficiency.”

Mere months after its last large-scale layoff, Meta is putting another set of jobs on the chopping block. The parent company of Facebook and Instagram will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The report was confirmed on March 14, when Meta announced layoffs affecting about 10,000 people, or 13% of its workforce, in another round of job cuts. The announcement was posted on the company’s website in a message titled “ Update on Meta’s Year of Efficiency. ”

Since mid-2022, Meta has been struggling to reel back costs. It spent too much, too quickly, on its big metaverse dreams while ad revenue slid due to a macroeconomic downturn and increased competition. A $12-a-month subscription for blue ticks won’t be enough to make up for it all.

A brief timeline of Meta’s jobs shuffle

November 2022: Meta trimmed its workforce by 13% last November, when it slashed 11,000 roles to save costs and increase efficiency. It was the first time since Facebook was founded 18 years ago that the company announced mass layoffs.

Advertisement

January 2023: Meta rescinds full-time offers made to a “small number of candidates” while it readjusts hiring priorities—a cut of this kind is a first for the company. Engineer and writer Gergely Orosz tweeted that the decision affected around 20 new grads in London with offers due to start in February.

February 2023: Meta starts “flattening” its organizational structure, asking managers and directors to transition to individual contributor jobs—non-managerial posts focused on coding, designing and research—or leave. It also delays setting team budgets as it plans a fresh round of layoffs.

Culling the Metaverse

Besides all the payrolls, there’s another massive black hole that’s been sucking Meta’s money: the metaverse.

Just after the pandemic, when everyone was working, living, and breathing online, Zuckerbeg floated the metaverse as the next big thing and touted Facebook as its leader. He went all in to create an immersive world that can be accessed through virtual reality (VR) headsets and special glasses—albeit a slightly creepy world of floating torsos. It led to a brand and name change, and gobbled up billions of dollars in investment.

But it didn’t quite catch on.

Nobody used Horizon Worlds, the social universe that was quickly dismissed as a poor quality video game despite Zuckerberg’s insistence that it was more. In making it accessible, Meta made it subpar. And if Zuckerberg thought he could tap into the 13- to 17-year-old market to make the product work, he has to think again. US Senators are opposing the move to open the platform to teens.

Zuckerberg is quietly killing the metaverse and pivoting to a “new top-level product group at Meta focused on generative AI to turbocharge our work in this area,” as he wrote in a Feb. 27 Facebook post—the same day OpenAI teased dialogue-based ChatGPT. The team building AI-powered products is led by Ahmad Al-Dahle, who’ll report to Facebook Meta’s chief product officer Chris Cox.

Facebook’s focus on ChatGPT-like AI

Last month, on Feb. 24, the company introduced a new large language model called LLaMA, short for Large Language Model Meta AI. It’s the core software of a new artificial intelligence system, which entails mining vast amounts of text in order to summarize information and generate content.

“In the short term, we’ll focus on building creative and expressive tools. Over the longer term, we’ll focus on developing AI personas that can help people in a variety of ways,” Zuckerberg wrote in his post.

For now, the most pronounced remnant of that remains of the metaverse is the hardware–the headsets—meant for enthusiasts like gamers and crypto fans.

Quotable: Meta messed up the Metaverse mission

“It’s just flabbergasting to me that people with so many resources can so spectacularly mess things up when the opportunity to do something cool is there,” -Celia Pearce, a professor of game design at Northeastern who has been studying non-game virtual worlds since the mid-1990s, on the Metaverse failure

Meta’s dashed Metaverse dreams, by the digits

42%: Share of 1,000 Meta employees surveyed in October 2022 who did not understand and internalize the company’s metaverse vision

$24 billion: Cumulative loss amassed by Reality Labs, the division housing metaverse projects, in 2021 and 2022. Of this, $13.7 billion was last year’s loss, which grew from the year before.

“About 80%...a little more”: Meta’s investments going towards the core business, namely its family of apps—Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and the ads business associated with that.

“A little less than 20%”: Meta’s investment goes towards Reality Labs, as told to The New York Times Dealbook conference last November.

$562 billion: The current market cap of the once trillion dollar company Meta

275%: How much more expensive Meta’s Quest Pro VR headset was that its predecessor Quest 2 at $1,500 when it launched five months ago

$1,000: The price of Meta’s Quest Pro VR headset fell 33% in the US and Canada as of Sunday (Mar. 5) as Meta brings it in line with competitors like HTC Vive XR Elite. By March 15, other markets are due to follow suit

$30: The difference between the low-end, 128GB version of the Quest 2 headset at $400 and the expanded-storage 256GB Quest 2 headset, which is now retailing at $430 instead of $500

20 million: Units of the Quest line sold to date, but how often are they being used? Meta Vice President for VR Mark Rabkin reportedly told employees that “the newer cohorts that are coming in…they’re just not as into it.” Maybe the thinner 2024 variant at “the most attractive price point in the VR consumer market” will make it more popular.

"Update on October 27, 2023 at 12:00PM PT:

This update to the “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool is now live on Instagram Feed as well.

Originally published on February 14, 2023 at 9:00AM PT:

Today, we are launching the next iteration of the “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool, which we created nearly a decade ago to give people information about why they see certain ads across our technologies. Since its initial launch, we’ve made improvements to “Why am I seeing this ad?” to make it easier to use and understand. Today’s update takes it one step further and now includes information about how we use machine learning models to show people ads.

What’s New

Beginning today, the “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool on Facebook will include:

Information summarized into topics about how your activity both on and off our technologies — such as liking a post on a friend’s Facebook page or interacting with your favorite sports website — may inform the machine learning models we use to shape and deliver the ads you see.

New examples and illustrations explaining how our machine learning models connect various topics to show you relevant ads.

More ways to find our ads controls. You will now be able to access Ads Preferences from additional pages in the “Why am I seeing this ad?” tool.

Why We Built This

We worked closely with external privacy experts and policy stakeholders from around the world to get input on what transparency changes they want to see in our ads system. A consistent answer was that we should increase our transparency around how our machine learning models contribute to the ads people see on our services.

We are committed to using machine learning models responsibly. Being transparent about how we use machine learning is essential because it ensures that people are aware that this technology is a part of our ads system and that they know the types of information it is using. By stepping up our transparency around how our machine learning models work to deliver ads, we aim to help people feel more secure and increase our accountability. The changes we’re making to “Why am I seeing this ad?” reflect the feedback we’ve received and are designed to provide people with clear information about the machine learning models that help determine the ads they see.

These new features are the latest step in our continuous evolution of “Why am I seeing this ad?” We will continue to improve our ads transparency offerings and search for new ways to provide people with better understanding of how we use data and technology to show them ads.

Where Can I Find “Why am I seeing this ad?”

You can click on the three-dot menu in the upper-right-hand corner of any ad you see in your Facebook Feed and navigate to “Why am I seeing this ad.” If an explanation in the tool is unclear or confusing, we want to hear about it.

You can use the feedback tool at the bottom of “Why am I seeing this ad?” to tell us about your experience and how we can do better. As always, you can still hide all ads from a given advertiser and access your ads preferences from the “Why am I seeing this ad?” interface.

This updated version of “Why am I seeing this ad?” is rolling out globally on Facebook first, and we plan on expanding it to Instagram in the future.","(facebook, parent-subsidiary, instagram)

"Today we’re announcing new ways for creators to test their content and understand performance to grow on Facebook. All of this is made possible in professional dashboard, our one-stop-shop for all creator resources.

Test Different Reels Content to See What Works Best

Selecting the right image and text to accompany your reel helps draw your audience in, but it can be hard to know what will resonate. We’re rolling out a Reels A/B testing tool that allows creators to test different captions and thumbnails on their mobile device to see which one performs best.

While creating a Reel on mobile, you can test up to four different captions or thumbnails. Results of the test will appear in your professional dashboard and we’ll automatically display the winning variant on your profile or page unless you change it. We’re also experimenting with incorporating generative AI to help you create different caption and thumbnail options in the future.

You can now also easily create Reels from your existing video posts and livestreams. On mobile, select from Your Content within the Reels composer and add finishing touches before posting to Facebook.

Track Your Progress and Earn Rewards

Over the past year, we’ve rolled out a number of features in professional dashboard to help creators learn tips and earn badges for reaching their goals.

We’re now rolling out the Achievements hub in professional dashboard where you can see all your achievements across Education, Stars, Reels and Progression in one place. There’s also a new achievement called Reels streaks earned by posting Reels on a weekly basis. Note: you will only see achievements you’re eligible for.

And while these Achievements on their own may help you grow on Facebook, to make them even more worth your while, we’re testing rewards for reaching different milestones. Creators who are 18+ that finish all Progression levels can become eligible to get increased visibility in Feed or have the Rising Creator label featured on their page or profile – both of which may help you get discovered more easily.

And once you’ve completed all the Progression levels, you’re eligible to participate in our newly launched weekly challenges. Every Monday a new challenge sets a series of tasks designed to help you continue your creator journey, such as posting or replying to comments a certain amount of times or reaching a designated number of reels plays or interactions.

Manage Your Content In One Place

We’ve added a content management tool to professional dashboard where you can see all your posts, reels and videos in one place. From there, you can easily view each individual post and take actions like hiding it from your profile and pages or moving it to the trash. You can also see content performance insights. Previously creators had to go through each post individually in their feed.

Access More Powerful Insights

Whether you create content on Facebook or crosspost from Instagram, Insights in professional dashboard provide the information you need to analyze your performance on Facebook and make more content that will resonate with your audience.

Now when you visit Insights you’ll see your account highlights for the week (both aggregated and individually), revealing insights on your posting habits, your audience and your content’s performance.

When you dig into content insights you can now view data spanning the past 90 days, a notable increase from the previous 28 day timeframe, providing a more comprehensive understanding of your content’s long-term performance.

We’ve also rolled out a number of new Reels metrics on professional dashboard, including Reels-specific Reach broken down by followers and non-followers, a distribution score that tells you how your Reel did compared to your other Reels and an audience retention graph showing how long your audience watched a Reel and when they stopped watching it. We’re also updating our Reels plays metrics to include replays, so you’ll have a better sense of how each Reel is performing and which ones resonate most with your audience.

Find Answers When You Need Help

And finally, we’re launching search and shortcuts in the Creator Support Hub on mobile within professional dashboard. When troubleshooting something or wanting to learn more about a topic, the search function will show you relevant Help Center articles to answer your question – no more scrolling article-by-article for answers!

New shortcuts on popular topics will bring you directly to the right place to easily check on your monetization eligibility, see payout information and learn more about products such as Meta Verified.

"The world we live in has never been more interconnected, giving people access to more multilingual content than ever before. This also makes the ability to communicate and understand information in any language increasingly important.

Today, we’re introducing SeamlessM4T, the first all-in-one multimodal and multilingual AI translation model that allows people to communicate effortlessly through speech and text across different languages. SeamlessM4T supports:

Speech recognition for nearly 100 languages

Speech-to-text translation for nearly 100 input and output languages

Speech-to-speech translation, supporting nearly 100 input languages and 36 (including English) output languages

Text-to-text translation for nearly 100 languages

Text-to-speech translation, supporting nearly 100 input languages and 35 (including English) output languages

In keeping with our approach to open science, we’re publicly releasing SeamlessM4T under a research license to allow researchers and developers to build on this work. We’re also releasing the metadata of SeamlessAlign, the biggest open multimodal translation dataset to date, totaling 270,000 hours of mined speech and text alignments.

Building a universal language translator, like the fictional Babel Fish in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, is challenging because existing speech-to-speech and speech-to-text systems only cover a small fraction of the world’s languages. But we believe the work we’re announcing today is a significant step forward in this journey. Compared to approaches using separate models, SeamlessM4T’s single system approach reduces errors and delays, increasing the efficiency and quality of the translation process. This enables people who speak different languages to communicate with each other more effectively.

SeamlessM4T builds on advancements we and others have made over the years in the quest to create a universal translator. Last year, we released No Language Left Behind (NLLB), a text-to-text machine translation model that supports 200 languages, and has since been integrated into Wikipedia as one of the translation providers. We also shared a demo of our Universal Speech Translator, which was the first direct speech-to-speech translation system for Hokkien, a language without a widely used writing system. And earlier this year, we revealed Massively Multilingual Speech, which provides speech recognition, language identification and speech synthesis technology across more than 1,100 languages.

SeamlessM4T draws on findings from all of these projects to enable a multilingual and multimodal translation experience stemming from a single model, built across a wide range of spoken data sources with state-of-the-art results.

This is only the latest step in our ongoing effort to build AI-powered technology that helps connect people across languages. In the future, we want to explore how this foundational model can enable new communication capabilities — ultimately bringing us closer to a world where everyone can be understood.

"While the metaverse is still in the early stages of development, it’s already possible to see its potential in areas like education, gaming, wellness and commerce. As metaverse technologies are more widely adopted more economic opportunities will emerge such as opening up new markets and business models, creating better ways of working and transforming training and development. This new series of research examines the economic potential of the metaverse for different countries and regions around the world.

These reports look at how metaverse technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are already being used locally, and what it might take to maximize economic opportunities in each country and region giving governments and industry the ability to make evidence-based decisions about the policies they adopt and where they focus their efforts. The reports, commissioned by Meta and produced by Deloitte, examine the economic opportunity that could be achieved in the US, Canada, the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Turkey and Asia. We’ve also estimated the economic potential of the metaverse for the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom.

The research finds that the United States is well positioned to harness the potential of the metaverse and lead its global development — both of which are expected to bring significant benefit to the US economy and could contribute between US$402 billion and US$760 billion in annual GDP by 2035. The report notes that American businesses are already using metaverse technologies to create new revenue streams and improve existing ones. US brands and retailers have already begun selling virtual versions of their products, in addition to the physical goods they already sell. Other American companies are using the metaverse to market their physical goods and enable customers to try before they buy with virtual overlays.

The US report also outlines how American companies are starting to see signs of greater operational efficiencies in areas like training employees in immersive VR, improving remote work by making online interactions more life-like and creating virtual replicas to optimize physical processes. This is already happening, for example, with US companies using digital twins to optimize the design of objects or buildings before their manufacturing or construction gets underway, offering the potential to save businesses time and money.

Likewise, the research highlights that the EU already has relatively high rates of business adoption for technologies like AR and VR — with rates in the EU (10%) higher than in the US (9%). Moreover, achievement of strong digital foundations is a key part of the European Commission’s Digital Decade vision. Like their US counterparts, European retail brands are already exploring how they can connect with consumers in the metaverse. EU farmers are trialing how metaverse technology can improve production, and European automotive manufacturers are developing VR-based systems to design and reconfigure their factories and training systems to improve safety and efficiency. According to the research, continued successful development of the metaverse could contribute an additional €259-€489 billion per year to the region’s GDP by 2035.

As the report sets out, the Middle East and North Africa are on a journey of economic transformation and digitalization, and regional businesses and governments are showing a growing appetite for new digital and immersive tools. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia (KSA) are taking a leading role, actively investing in metaverse ecosystems. KSA is investing US$1 billion in metaverse-related projects as it seeks to become a global technology hub. Similarly, Dubai has launched a Metaverse Strategy, aiming to “turn Dubai into one of the world’s top 10 metaverse economies” by focusing on innovation in tourism, real estate, education, retail and government services. According to this research, metaverse technologies could bring significant benefits to the region’s economy, with the benefits to KSA’s economy potentially reaching US$20.2 – $38.1 billion in additional GDP by 2035. In the UAE, those benefits could reach US$8.8–$16.7 billion.

Asia Pacific is a world leader when it comes to the development and adoption of metaverse technologies. Last year’s analysis produced independently by Deloitte Centre for the Edge estimated that the impact of the metaverse to regional GDP could be between US$0.8 and 1.4 trillion per year by 2035. Japan, Taiwan and Korea all have flourishing VR industry ecosystems, and people are already learning, socializing, purchasing items, gaming and accessing social services on virtual platforms. Several governments in the region, including South Korea and Japan, have featured the metaverse in their economic plans.

In developing markets such as Thailand, India and Indonesia where VR technology is not yet commonplace, there is a booming creator economy and they are leading the world with AR technology. The metaverse is creating new marketplaces, new types of businesses, new employment opportunities and opening up new ways of working in Asia Pacific and creators are at the forefront of bringing this future closer.

The metaverse continues to hold significant promise for driving creativity and economic opportunity around the world. Maximizing its potential will depend on maintaining effective openness throughout the metaverse ecosystem, while ensuring appropriate safeguards for users as they engage with immersive experiences. Doing so will require the continued cooperation and collaboration of tech companies, policymakers, academics and civil society globally.

"“Raise your hand if you know who is getting fired?” a Meta employee wrote in an online chat group for the company’s engineers this month. “Fire emoji if you think it’s a dumpster fire.”

In response, his colleagues posted dozens of tiny flame emojis.

“I’m already fired,” added a former Meta employee who worked in the company’s business division for nearly four years before most of his team was laid off this year. “But who can keep track?”

Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, has declared that 2023 will be the “year of efficiency” at his company. So far, efficiency has translated into mass layoffs. He has conducted two rounds of cuts over the past six months, with two more to come; these will eliminate more than 21,000 people. Mr. Zuckerberg is also closing 5,000 open positions, which amounts to 30 percent of his company’s work force.","(meta, primary operator, technology)

"Sometimes separate is simpler, so we’re making it easier to customize your experience on Facebook with multiple personal profiles. Whether you’re new to Facebook or a longtime user, you may want to keep your personal and professional relationships separate, or you may want to keep one profile tied to a community you’re a part of and another profile just for friends. Creating multiple personal profiles lets you easily organize who you share with and what content you see for the various parts of your life. Think one profile for the foodie scene you love and another one to keep up with your friends and family.

We already offer controls that let you choose what audience you’re sharing with on Facebook, but after experimenting with multiple profiles over the last year, we heard from people that clearer organization of friends, groups, and interests helps them feel freer to engage with the audience they believe is most relevant. And we’ve seen the success of separate interest-based accounts on Instagram, so we’re excited to bring this option to Facebook. The ability to create multiple personal profiles is starting to roll out globally today and will continue over the next few months.

How it works

Choose a name and have an @username for up to four additional personal profiles.

Connect with the people or communities you choose so each profile has a unique Feed with relevant content and shared interests.

Easily switch between your profiles, with no login required.

At launch, some Facebook features — such as Dating, Marketplace, Professional Mode and payments — will not be available to additional personal profiles. To start, messaging will be available within the Facebook app and on the web for additional personal profiles. We plan to expand Messenger support for additional profiles in the coming months. The option for an additional personal profile will be available only to eligible adult accounts.

Controls

When you create an additional personal profile, its settings are automatically set to default settings — notification and privacy settings from one profile don’t carry over to your other profiles. Additionally, some settings are managed separately for each profile, such as choosing who can see that profile’s posts or who can send friend requests to that profile. We recommend checking your privacy settings for each new profile you create, and you can update privacy settings for your profiles at any time. Your main Facebook profile won’t show that you have additional personal profiles.

Authenticity and Responsibility

Our longstanding policy on Account Integrity and Authentic Identity states that your main Facebook profile must be in the name you go by in everyday life — and this is not changing. You can choose any name for your additional profiles, but not for your main profile. We remain committed to preventing impersonation and identity misrepresentation, so additional profiles cannot impersonate others or be used to misrepresent your identity (including your age or location).

As always, all profiles must comply with Facebook’s Community Standards. If someone has recently or repeatedly violated our policies, they will not be able to create additional profiles. If someone repeatedly violates our policies using any of their additional personal profiles, appropriate action will be taken on their account and all associated profiles. You can learn more about policies specific to additional personal profiles here.","(technology, r&d participant, facebook)

"Meta announced Wednesday that it would require advertisers to disclose when potentially misleading AI-generated or altered content is featured in political, electoral, or social issue ads.

The new rule applies to advertisements on Facebook and Instagram that contain “realistic” images, videos, or audio falsely showing someone doing something they never did or imagining a real event playing out differently than it did in reality. Content depicting realistic-looking fake people or events would also need to be disclosed. The policy is expected to go into effect next year.

“In the New Year, advertisers who run ads about social issues, elections & politics with Meta will have to disclose if image or sound has been created or altered digitally, including with AI, to show real people doing or saying things they haven’t done or said,” Nick Clegg, Meta president of global affairs, said in a Threads post Wednesday.

Content that’s been edited in ways “that are inconsequential or immaterial to the claim, assertion, or issue raised in the ad,” like cropping or color correcting, does not need to be disclosed, according to Meta’s Wednesday blog post.

For ads containing digitally altered content, Meta says it will flag the information to users and log it in Meta’s ads database.

Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Meta was banning political campaigns and groups from using its new slate of generative AI advertising products. The tools allow advertisers to create multiple versions of ads, including different backgrounds, text, and image and video sizing.

The decision to disclose AI-generated content in political ads comes as lawmakers and regulators are preparing to take on the issue themselves ahead of the 2024 presidential election.","(meta, regulatory body, facebook)

"New York CNN —

Months after Apple unveiled a privacy change that threatened Facebook’s core advertising business, the social networking company rebranded as Meta and shifted its focus to virtual reality.

Now, less than two years later, Apple may be threatening Meta’s business there, too.

Apple (AAPL) on Monday unveiled its mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, in one of its most ambitious product launches in years. At the kickoff of the company’s annual developer conference, Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook touted the Vision Pro, a $3,499 device that combines virtual reality and augmented reality, as a “revolutionary product,” with the potential to change how users interact with technology.

The new Apple product, set to launch early next year, puts Apple in direct competition with Meta, which has been building headsets for years.

On Thursday, just days before WWDC, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg tried to preempt the expected Apple headset announcement by teasing the Meta Quest 3. The new headset promises improved performance, new mixed-reality features and a sleeker, more comfortable design, at a much more affordable price ($499).

Every period of consumer tech seems to be shaped by heated rivalries. Apple’s competition with Microsoft (MSFT) was central to the early personal computing era. Apple’s late CEO Steve Jobs declared “thermonuclear war” against Google over smartphones. Now, Apple and Meta could be the defining rivalry of the VR/AR era.

The two companies had a tense relationship even before Apple’s entry into the market. They have competed over news and messaging features, and their CEOs have traded jabs over data privacy and app store policies. Last February, Meta said it expected to take a $10 billion hit in 2022 from Apple’s move to limit how apps like Facebook collect data for targeted ads.

But the rivalry appears poised to reach a new level.

Meta has until now been the dominant player in the headset market. But virtual and augmented reality remains a nascent market with little mainstream consumer adoption. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Meta had just 200,000 active users in Horizon Worlds, its app for socializing in VR. And in 2023, IDC estimates just 10.1 million AR/VR headsets will ship globally from the entire market, far below the tens of millions of iPhones Apple sells each quarter.

Morgan Stanley analysts called Apple’s Vision Pro a “moonshot” effort following its announcement on Monday, saying the product “has the potential to become Apple’s next compute platform,” but that the company has “much to prove” before the headset’s launch next year.

“We’re always happy when more people join us in building the future,” Sheeva Slovan, a spokesperson for Meta’s Reality Labs unit, said in a statement to CNN.

A battle to dominate an uncertain market

Apple and Meta may end up racing to see not only who can get consumers to choose their product, but whether either of them can get millions of customers to buy into this new wave of technology at all.

Apple in many ways seems to have the upper hand, with its existing loyal customer base of more than two billion devices, impressive hardware chops and access to hundreds of stores where consumers can potentially try on the device.

“Everything up until this moment has kind of felt like the pregame for me, of preparing for this moment when Apple would take this to the public consciousness and let people know, hey, these technologies are for real, this isn’t just a gimmick,” Eric Alexander, founder of VR music experiences app Soundscape, told CNN following Apple’s announcement.

The iPhone maker also appears to be marketing its device differently. Apple chose not to focus on the term “virtual reality,” nor did it show off disembodied avatars without legs inhabiting a virtual world, as Meta did initially. Instead, Apple played up the headset’s potential to integrate much more seamlessly with users’ real-world lives through augmented reality, a technology that can overlay virtual objects on live video of the real world.

“I don’t think Apple views itself in competition with Meta,” said Julie Ask, principal analyst at Forrester. Zuckerberg is “all in on this virtual world, and that’s not what Apple is about. Apple is saying, ‘We don’t think people want to be disconnected from the real world … we want to enhance the world that consumers are in.’”

The Quest 3 headset that Meta teased last week is also a mixed reality headset with AR capabilities, so it seems likely that Meta may veer closer to Apple’s approach in the future. However, a demo video Zuckerberg posted to Instagram seems to imply the device is still largely gaming focused.

Many analysts say that the biggest hurdle to consumer adoption of mixed reality headsets is ensuring that there is a wide range of potential use cases and experiences available on the devices.

While Meta has introduced features that let users play games, explore virtual worlds, watch YouTube videos, workout, chat with friends and more, it has yet to convince most consumers that the device is worthwhile.

Apple’s announcement at WWDC seems targeted at ensuring that the large base of developers in its ecosystem will help create enticing new experiences for the device before its launch.

Developing new AR and VR apps requires significant investment, not to mention hands-on time with a device, Alexander said, so it may be a while before a wide range of experiences are available for the Vision Pro. The lack of controllers and other accessories could also make it difficult for developers to create certain types of apps, such as games, for the new device.

Still, at the Monday event, Apple touted features from Disney, such as Disney+, and gaming company Unity, that will be available on the device from the start, on top of the iPhone maker’s existing suite of services.

Apple’s Vision One “isn’t a device that I will buy and think, ‘Oh, now I need to go buy content,’” said Forrester’s Ask. “This is a device that if I do buy it, it has a very intuitive interface … it’s a place I can watch my Apple TV and movies and all of those things. It’s not, ‘Oh, I bought this device now what do I do with it?’”

D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte compared the Vision Pro’s launch to the introduction of the iPhone following the Blackberry, an unfavorable comparison that would likely make Zuckerberg grimace. (Forte did note that Meta’s headset seems less likely to fade into irrelevance, as the Blackberry eventually did.)

“Blackberry had proven that there was a market for smartphones and had built a dominant position, but what it didn’t really do was the apps,” Forte said, adding that the iPhone introduced the idea of having a range of different use cases for one device. “In some regards, it’s like the iPhone where we’re going to need to see the ecosystem develop over time for this to succeed.”

But if Apple does succeed at driving widespread consumer adoption of mixed reality headsets, Meta could still benefit by extension by being the budget pick, Forte said.

Meta will create a new product group inside the company focused on generative AI, a new set of machine learning techniques that allow computers to generate text, draw pictures, and create other media that resemble human output.

The move comes as big tech companies and well-capitalized startups alike race to tout advances in machine learning techniques and incorporate artificial intelligence models into their products.

The unit will combine several teams across Meta, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. The new group will be organized under current Chief Product Officer Chris Cox.

Zuckerberg said that the team would build ""creative and expressive"" tools to be used inside Meta's products.

""We're exploring experiences with text (like chat in WhatsApp and Messenger), with images (like creative Instagram filters and ad formats), and with video and multi-modal experiences,"" Zuckerberg said. ""We have a lot of foundational work to do before getting to the really futuristic experiences, but I'm excited about all of the new things we'll build along the way.""

For example, large language models created by OpenAI have been integrated into a Microsoft Bing chatbot as well as a separate chatbot called ChatGPT. Google is also working on a chatbot named Bard.

On Monday, Snap announced that it would integrate a ChatGPT bot into its Snapchat app.

Last week, Meta announced its own new large language model called LLaMA. Meta said at the time that its models are distinguished because they are available to researchers and that they are smaller and less expensive to use than larger models.

But the announcement was also a sign that Meta, which does a significant amount of research into artificial intelligence, was not going to let competitors pass it by in the AI race.","(meta, product manufacturer, generative ai)

"Video is core to Facebook – short videos could be posted to Feed as early as 2007. Nowadays, our unique cross-section of Reels, long-form and Live content brings people to Facebook to watch videos about the things they like, new stuff they’d want to know about, and to engage with real people with similar interests.

We continue to invest heavily in video, so today we’re sharing the latest ways we’re making it possible for people to create, explore, and engage with video on Facebook.

Video Editing Made Easier

We’ve started to roll out updates that will bring more Reels editing tools to Feed, making it even easier to create dynamic videos on Facebook. Whether posting a video for friends and family to see, or trying to reach people who share similar interests, our video editing tools will make it possible for people to express themselves in new ways via Reels or long-form videos.

Seamless editing: We brought audio, music and text all into one place on Reels, making it easier to layer and time creative elements to create the perfect reel. And now, it’s also available on Meta Business Suite for reels and for video on Feed.

We brought audio, music and text all into one place on Reels, making it easier to layer and time creative elements to create the perfect reel. And now, it’s also available on Meta Business Suite for reels and for video on Feed. More clip editing tools: Get creative with your video by speeding up, reversing or replacing your clips.

Get creative with your video by speeding up, reversing or replacing your clips. Enhanced audio: Mix the right sound into your video by exploring and adding music and audio clips, recording voiceovers and reducing unwanted noise.

People also now have the ability to upload HDR videos from their phone to Reels and for that video to play back in full HDR, the first of our efforts to bring true HDR video support to our family of apps.

All Videos in One Place on Facebook

We’re also making it simpler to explore and engage with the best videos on Facebook – whether you’re looking for popular reels, long-form videos from top creators or Live content.

The Video tab, previously known as Facebook Watch, is now the one-stop shop for everything video on Facebook, including Reels, long-form and Live content. The Video tab will look familiar – you can scroll vertically through a personalized feed that recommends all types of video content – but will also feature new horizontal-scroll reels sections that highlight recommended reels, so you can quickly jump into short-form video. You’ll see Video as a tab in the shortcut bar soon: on iOS, this bar is found at the bottom of the app, and on Android, it’s found at the top. The tabs in the shortcut bar change based on the parts of the app you use the most.

Discover Popular Videos on Facebook

We’ve redesigned video Explore to help you discover and dive deeper into popular video topics. You can find Explore by tapping the search icon in the Video tab. Here you’ll see a variety of reels, long-form and live videos related to relevant topics and hashtags. We use a mix of human curation and machine learning to select topics and videos that are popular and surface the ones we think you will enjoy and find interesting.

Engage with Instagram Reels on Facebook

The ability to watch Instagram Reels on Facebook has helped many Instagram creators reach more people – even for creators who don’t have an active Facebook profile. It also lets people enjoy the best of Instagram and Facebook Reels all in one place.

Now on Facebook, you can view and write comments on Instagram Reels that have been recommended to you on Facebook without needing to switch between apps. To get started, you can add your Facebook and Instagram accounts to Accounts Center. This makes it even easier to connect with the things and people that you care about, regardless of which app you use.

This is just the beginning. We’ll continue developing more tools for creators so they can express themselves, build an audience and earn money, along with the discovery and personalization features that give you more control over your experience.","(facebook, cross-marketing allies, instagram reels)

"CNN —

Roughly a year-and-a-half after Facebook renamed itself “Meta” and said it would go all-in on building a future version of the internet dubbed the metaverse, the tech giant now says its top investment priority will be advancing artificial intelligence.

In a letter to staff Tuesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to lay off another 10,000 employees in the coming months, and doubled down on his new focus of “efficiency” for the company. The pivot to efficiency, first announced last month in Meta’s quarterly earnings call, comes after years of investing heavily in growth, including in areas with unproven potential like virtual reality.

Now, Zuckerberg says the company will focus mostly on cutting costs and streamlining projects. Building the metaverse “remains central to defining the future of social connection,” Zuckerberg wrote, but that isn’t where Meta will be putting most of its capital.

“Our single largest investment is in advancing AI and building it into every one of our products,” Zuckerberg said Tuesday. He nodded to how AI tools can help users of its apps express themselves and “discover new content,” but also said that new AI tools can be used to increase efficiencies internally by helping “engineers write better code faster.”

The comments come after what the CEO described as a “humbling wake-up call” last year, as the “world economy changed, competitive pressures grew, and our growth slowed considerably.”

Meta and its predecessor Facebook have been involved in AI research for years, but the remarks come amid a heightened AI frenzy in the tech world, kicked off in late November when Microsoft-backed OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT. The technology quickly went viral for its ability to generate compelling, human-sounding responses to user prompts and then kicked off an apparent AI arms race among tech companies. Microsoft announced in early February that it was incorporating the tech behind ChatGPT into its search engine, Bing. A day before Microsoft’s announcement, Google unveiled its own AI-powered tool called Bard. And not to be left behind, Meta announced late last month that it was forming a “top-level product group” to “turbocharge” the company’s work on AI tools.

“I do think it is a good thing to focus on AI,” Ali Mogharabi, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNN of Zuckerberg’s comments. Mogharabi said Meta’s investments in AI “has benefits on both ends” because it can improve efficiency for engineers creating products, and because incorporating AI features into Meta’s lineup of apps will potentially create more engagement time for users, which can then drive advertising revenue.

And in the long run, Mogharabi said, “A lot of the investments in AI, and a lot of enhancements that come from those investments in AI, could actually be applicable to the entire metaverse project.”

But Zuckerberg’s emphasis on investing in AI, and using the buzzy technology’s tools to make the company more efficient and boost its bottom line, is also “what the shareholders and the market want to hear,” Mogharabi said. Many investors had previously griped at the company’s metaverse ambitions and spending. In 2022, Meta lost more than $13.7 billion in its “Reality Labs” unit, which houses its metaverse efforts.

And investors appear to welcome Zuckerberg’s shift in focus from the metaverse to efficiency. After taking a beating in 2022, shares for Meta have surged more than 50% since the start of the year.

Angelo Zino, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said on Tuesday that the second round of layoffs at Meta “officially make us convinced that Mark Zuckerberg has completely switched gears, altering the narrative of the company to one focused on efficiencies rather than looking to grow the metaverse at any cost.”","(technology, r&d participant, meta)

"Since launching Meta Horizon Worlds, we’ve been amazed by the creativity on display as our community of artists, world builders, and explorers has begun to form. Until now, Worlds has been limited to those 18 and up, but Meta Quest is rated 13+, so we’re excited to begin opening Worlds to teens ages 13 to 17 in the US and Canada in the coming weeks with a robust set of age-appropriate protections and safety defaults. Now, teens will be able to explore immersive worlds, play games like Arena Clash and Giant Mini Paddle Golf, enjoy concerts and live comedy events, connect with others from around the world, and express themselves as they create their own virtual experiences.



Teens have already become fans of popular virtual experiences across the industry—this makes it crucial that we build age-appropriate, safe, and positive experiences for them in VR. Doing so is core to our responsible innovation principles and our commitment to building safer experiences for young people. That’s why we invested in a number of new safety features including back-end protections and parental supervision tools that allows parents and teens to help manage the experience before making Worlds available to this age group. We’re rolling out to teens slowly, so that we can carefully examine usage and are taking a phased approach before expanding more broadly. We can’t wait to see everything these new members of the community bring to Worlds.

Giving Teens Customized Controls with Age-appropriate Settings

As we open Worlds to teens, we’re committed to providing them with a safe, age-appropriate experience. We’ve designed and built the teen experience with a robust set of protections and safety defaults, including:

Meta Horizon profile privacy settings : Teens are in control of who they follow and who can follow them back. Teens’ profiles are automatically set to private, so they’re able to approve or decline anyone who requests to follow them.

Active status settings: By default, we won’t show a teen’s active status and Meta Horizon Worlds location to other people in Worlds. Teens will be able to choose whether their connections can see if they’re active online and which public world or event they’re in.

World and event content ratings : We use content ratings to ensure teens have an age-appropriate experience within Worlds. For example, mature world and event ratings prevent teens from finding, seeing, or entering spaces that contain mature content . Our policies prohibit teens from publishing mature worlds or events. Worlds violating this policy will be removed.

Voice mode : This feature transforms the voices of people a teen doesn’t know into quiet, friendly sounds, giving teens more control over who can communicate with them. It also garbles the teen’s voice, so people they don’t know can’t hear them. We turn garbled voices on automatically for all teens by default within voice mode.

Limiting interactions between teens + adults they don’t know : We want to help prevent teens from hearing from adults they may not know. That’s why we take steps to prevent interactions between adults and unconnected teens. For example, we don’t display any adults a teen doesn’t know in their “people you might know” list.

Everyone, including teens, will have access to additional Worlds safety tools, including safe zone and personal boundary. Meta Horizon Worlds’ teen safety features have been designed with input from parents, safety advocates, and experts, including ConnectSafely, and we continue to design with best practices from the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and youth developmental experts in mind. We’re also continuing to invest in new and innovative ways to provide people with age-appropriate experiences.

Giving Parents Supervision Tools for Meta Horizon Worlds

We’ve expanded our existing VR parental supervision tools to include Meta Horizon Worlds, making it easier for parents and guardians to help manage their teens’ experience and support healthy conversations about safety in VR. Parents and guardians can set up Worlds parental supervision by inviting their teen to connect through Family Center—or teens can invite their parents or guardian to connect with them via the Meta Quest app or Family Center. Once connected, parents can see and adjust a variety of their teen’s settings not only for safety features within Worlds, but for the entire Meta Quest Platform.

Together, parental supervision on Meta Quest and Worlds lets parents and guardians:

See, adjust, and lock safety features like voice mode and personal boundary for their teen .

See who their teen follows and who follows their teen.

See which apps their teen has used and how much time they’ve spent in Meta Quest and Worlds in the past seven days.

Give permission to allow or block their teen from using apps, including Worlds.

Access resources about our available safety features .

Additionally, everyone—including teens—can cast their experience from Meta Quest, allowing them to share what they’re seeing in VR and Worlds with parents, guardians, or others around them. To learn more about settings on Meta Quest parental supervision, visit our Help Center.

Additional Education for Parents, Guardians, and Teens

We’ve built dedicated education for parents, guardians, and teens to better support teens’ experiences in Worlds:

Family Center for Worlds: Family Center is expanding to include Worlds. On Family Center, parents can access supervision tools, tips, and resources from experts and other information about online safety and well-being to support their teens’ experiences across Meta technologies.

In-product education for teens : We’ve built educational safety tips into the Worlds experience specifically for teens to remind them of safety best practices. For example, we’ll remind them to only accept follow requests from people they know.

We’re excited to welcome teens aged 13 to 17 in the US and Canada to Worlds in the coming weeks. And as we look toward the future metaverse, we’ll continue to explore ways we can make VR work well for families.

"Today, we’re updating and expanding our Ads on Reels tests so more creators can earn money for creating and sharing engaging public reels.

We’re inviting thousands more creators on Facebook to join our updated tests, including many of the creators who previously participated in our Reels Play bonus program on Facebook. And in the coming weeks, we’ll begin testing a similar program on Instagram.

We’re also evolving the program to pay creators based on the performance of their public reels, not the earnings of ads on their reels. This means creators can focus on creating engaging content while we optimize the ad experience for advertisers and people.

How to Earn

Payouts will be determined by the number of plays. The better a creator’s reel performs, the more they can earn. Over time we may begin to incorporate other signals into payouts.

Many variables outside of creators’ control have traditionally influenced their ad earnings, such as how many ads have already been shown to the person viewing their content or whether there’s a relevant ad to deliver that viewer. With a performance-based model, creators can focus on the content that’s resonating with their audiences and helping them grow; advertisers get access to more ad inventory to reach more people; and people get a more consistent viewing experience with more relevant ads.

All creators onboarding to the test will automatically be added to the new payout model, and over the coming weeks creators previously testing Ads on Facebook Reels will be transitioned. In addition, we’ll begin to test Ads on Instagram Reels with a similar performance-based payout model among a small group of creators and advertisers in select markets.

We also plan to start testing a performance-based payout model for In-Stream ads on Facebook with a small group of creators to support creators making all types of content.

How to Participate

To be eligible for an invite on Facebook, creators must live in one of 52 countries and meet several minimum requirements.

Once added to the test, in order to earn from Ads on Reels, creators must complete the onboarding process which includes accepting the terms of use and providing payout details. From there, they just need to continue creating engaging Reels to earn.

To check if you’re part of this initial program on Facebook, visit Professional Dashboard and go to the Monetization Tools section. If you are invited, you should see Ads on Reels and you can select Set up to begin onboarding.

"Rarely, if ever, do today’s online threats target one single technology platform – instead, they follow people across the internet. We go to great lengths to keep our apps safe for people and help raise our collective defenses across the internet. Today’s security and integrity updates provide an under-the-hood view into our defense strategy and the latest news on how we build it into products like our new app Threads and generative AI systems.

In the decade since we first began publishing transparency reports, technology companies and researchers have learned a great deal about how online public spaces can be abused by malicious actors. A key lesson for us has been that transparency across our industry has positive cascading effects on our collective ability to respond to new threats – from continuous pressure on malicious groups through takedowns and public exposure to government sanctions as well as stronger product defenses. Today’s updates are a good window into how this works in practice.

Taking Down Two of the Largest Known Covert Influence Operations

China: We recently took down thousands of accounts and Pages that were part of the largest known cross-platform covert influence operation in the world. It targeted more than 50 apps, including Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Pinterest, Medium, Blogspot, LiveJournal, VKontakte, Vimeo, and dozens of smaller platforms and forums. For the first time, we were able to tie this activity together to confirm it was part of one operation known in the security community as Spamouflage and link it to individuals associated with Chinese law enforcement. See details in our Q2 Adversarial Threat report.

Russia: We also blocked thousands of malicious website domains as well as attempts to run fake accounts and Pages on our platforms connected to the Russian operation known as Doppelganger that we first disrupted a year ago. This operation was focused on mimicking websites of mainstream news outlets and government entities to post fake articles aimed at weakening support for Ukraine. It has now expanded beyond initially targeting France, Germany and Ukraine to also include the US and Israel. This is the largest and the most aggressively-persistent Russian-origin operation we’ve taken down since 2017. In addition to new threat research, we’re also publishing our enforcement and policy recommendations for addressing the abuse of the global domain name registration system.

Examining Impact of Disrupting Hate Networks

We first began using what we call Strategic Network Disruptions in 2017 to tackle covert influence operations from Russia. As it proved to be an effective instrument in our toolbox, we expanded it to other issue areas, including hate networks, cyber espionage and mass reporting. But because we know that malicious groups keep evolving their tactics across the internet, we also continue to ask ourselves: do these strategies still work and how can we improve them?

Our team of researchers recently published a study of the effects of six network disruptions of banned hate-based organizations on Facebook. Their research found de-platforming these entities through network disruptions can help make the ecosystem less hospitable for designated dangerous organizations. While people closest to the core audience of these hate groups exhibit signs of backlash in the short-term, evidence suggests they reduce their engagement with the network and with hateful content over time. It also suggests that our strategies can reduce the ability of hate organizations to successfully operate online.

Building Threads and Generative AI Tools

While these network takedowns are impactful, they are just one tool in our broader defense against adversarial groups targeting people across the internet. Our investigations and enforcements power what we call a virtuous cycle of defense – improving our scaled systems and how we build new products.

Threads: From the beginning, our integrity enforcement systems and policies developed for Instagram, and other apps, have been wired into how we built Threads. You can think of it as Threads being built on top of an established, global infrastructure powering multiple apps at once. This means that our security efforts, like tackling covert influence operations, apply to Threads just as they do to Facebook and Instagram. In fact, within 24 hours of Threads launching, we detected and blocked attempts to establish a presence on Threads by accounts linked to an influence operation we took down in the past.

We’ve also rolled out additional transparency features on Threads, including labeling state-controlled media and showing additional information about accounts so that people can know, for example, if accounts may have changed their names. We know that adversarial behaviors will keep evolving as the Threads app continues to mature, and so will we, to stay ahead of these threats.

Generative AI: Openness and cross-society collaboration are even more critical when it comes to rapidly evolving technologies like generative AI. In addition to extensive internal “red teaming” where our internal teams take on the role of adversaries to hunt for flaws, we recently brought our generative AI model to DEFCON — the largest hacker conference in the world. We joined our peers at Google, NVIDIA, OpenAI and others to stress test our different models as part of the first-ever public Generative Red Team Challenge.

Over 2,200 researchers, including hundreds of students and organizations traditionally left out of the early stages of technological change, came together to hunt for bugs and vulnerabilities in these systems. According to the organizers of this challenge, they engaged in over 17,000 conversations with generative AI systems to probe for unintended behaviors – from bad math calculations to misinformation to providing bad user security practices. This open red team challenge was supported by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Science Foundation, and the Congressional AI Caucus. Our hope is that early focus on establishing best practices for this emerging generative AI space will result in safer systems in the long term.

We believe that openness is the key to tackling some of the biggest challenges we collectively face online. Transparency reports, academic research, and other measures to innovate openly and stress-test our systems help our industry to learn from each other, improve our respective systems, and keep people safe across the internet.

"Meta is building its first custom chip specifically for running AI models, the company announced on Thursday. As Meta increases its AI efforts — CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said the company sees “an opportunity to introduce AI agents to billions of people in ways that will be useful and meaningful” — the chip and other infrastructure plans revealed Thursday could be critical tools for Meta to compete with other tech giants also investing significant resources into AI.

Meta’s new MTIA chip, which stands for Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, is its “in-house, custom accelerator chip family targeting inference workloads,” Meta VP and head of infrastructure Santosh Janardhan wrote in a blog post. The chip apparently provides “greater compute power and efficiency” than CPUs and is “customized for our internal workloads.” With a combination of MTIA chips and GPUs, Janardhan said that Meta believes “we’ll deliver better performance, decreased latency, and greater efficiency for each workload.”

The MTIA could be a big boon for Meta, especially given increasingly high demand for AI compute power. But the MTIA chip is seemingly a long ways away: it’s not set to come out until 2025, TechCrunch reports.

In addition to the MTIA, Meta is also introducing a new ASIC specifically to help with video transcoding, which it calls the “MSVP,” or Meta Scalable Video Processor. It’s designed to support both “the high-quality transcoding needed for VOD as well as the low latency and faster processing times that live streaming requires,” Meta said in a separate blog post, and “in the future,” it will help bring things like AI-made content and AR- and VR-specific content to Meta’s apps.","(meta, product manufacturer, mtia chip)
