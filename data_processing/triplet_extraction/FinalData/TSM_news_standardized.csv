"L.A.-based TSM will be pausing most its esports efforts in several titles and may be putting its League of Legends Championship Series franchise on the block, sources tell SBJ. TSM is one of the more popular esports and lifestyle organizations within gaming, and also fields competitive squads in Valorant, Fortnite, Apex Legends, and others. Sources tell SBJ that TSM took a big financial hit when its 10-year, $210 million naming rights deal with FTX disappeared after the crypto brand infamously went belly up. That pact was the most lucrative in all of esports sponsorships.

The pausing of esports continues a period of significant change at TSM, which last month saw its COO depart the organization and in February saw its defending-champion Rainbow Six: Siege squad depart that esports circuit.

However, after the downfall of FTX last year TSM put out a statement that said, “TSM is built on a solid foundation. We are stable and profitable, and we continue to forecast profitability for this year, next year, and beyond. We look forward to a great year in 2023.""

Sources also tell SBJ that TSM will continue to focus on its Blitz application, a tool that helps video game players develop in-game skills and strategy in titles such as League of Legends, Valorant, and more.","(technology, product manufacturer, tsm)

"On Wednesday, TSM, one of the most iconic organizations in North American League of Legends esports, announced they had sold their League Championship Series (LCS) slot to Shopify Rebellion. Few LCS organizations can claim as great a legacy and large a fandom as TSM. TSM won seven LCS championships, the most of any team, and was the home of some of the best and most popular players in LCS history. It’s the end of an era in the LCS, so here’s a brief look back at the history of TSM in the LCS.

2011

TSM were one of the best North American teams early in the history of League of Legends esports. Formed by Andy ""Reginald"" Dinh, who was the team’s mid laner at the time, TSM were often the champs of the Go4LoL NA weekly tournament series. They qualified for the first-ever League of Legends World Championship (Worlds) and finished third in the eight-team tournament. The core initial roster was Christian ""The Rain Man"" Kahmann (top laner), Brian ""TheOddOne"" Wyllie (jungler), Reginald (mid laner), Shan ""Chaox"" Huang (AD carry) and Alex ""Xpecial"" Chu (support).

TSM had a great 2012 with great results at big events like IEM Season 6 Kiev (second), IPL 4 Las Vegas (first), MLG Spring Championship (first), IPL Face Off: San Francisco Showdown (first) and the Season 2 Regional Finals (first). TSM qualified for Worlds and finished 5th-8th. The team skipped the group stage as they qualified directly for the playoffs, but lost their initial matchup in the quarterfinals. This also was the year top laner Marcus ""Dyrus"" Hill joined the team. He is one of the best known TSM players during the team’s early history.

2013

This was the first year of the League Championship Series (LCS), the official North American League of Legends circuit organized by Riot Games. TSM finished first in the initial LCS split that spring and won the inaugural LCS championship that spring too. Jason ""WildTurtle"" Tran, now a well-known LCS veteran, joined TSM as their new AD carry this year. In the summer, TSM finished second to Cloud9, a team that would become one of TSM’s biggest rivals in the LCS. TSM again qualified for Worlds and finished 11th-12th.

2014

The most notable thing that happened for TSM in 2014 was the addition of Søren ""Bjergsen"" Bjerg, who replaced Reginald in the mid lane. Bjergsen would become the most iconic player in TSM history and would be a cornerstone for the team for the next few years. TSM again finished second to Cloud9 in the spring playoffs final but then beat them in the summer playoffs final. The team qualified for Worlds for the fourth consecutive year and had their best showing since 2011. They finished 5th-8th after making it through the group stage with a 4-2 record before losing in the quarterfinals to eventual champions Samsung Galaxy White.

2015

Despite the existence of the LCS, teams were still competing in IEM events, and in March, TSM won the IEM Season 9 World Championship. Of the 26 global IEM League of Legends tournaments held between 2011 and 2017, this was one of only three events won by North American teams. Of the six IEM World Championships, this was the only one won by an NA team. TSM were once again LCS champions, again with a victory over Cloud9 in the spring final. By winning the spring final, TSM qualified for the first-ever edition of the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI), Riot’s new international tournament besides Worlds. They finished fifth out of six teams. During the summer, TSM finished second in the playoffs and qualified for Worlds where they finished a disappointing 14th-16th.

2016

This was the year Yiliang (Peter) ""Doublelift"" Peng joined TSM and teamed up with Bjergsen to form one of the best duos in LCS history. After losing to Doublelift and CLG in the 2015 summer final, TSM added the CLG AD carry to replace WildTurtle. This also was the year Kevin ""Hauntzer"" Yarnell replaced TSM veteran Dyrus. TSM would lose the spring final to CLG again, but they did win the summer final. They qualified for Worlds again and finished 9th-12th despite all the star power.

2017

Wildturtle returned to TSM for the spring season as Doublelift was loaned out to Team Liquid. TSM won the spring split and went to MSI again and finished fifth again, though this time it was out of 13 teams. Doublelift returned in the summer and it was the same result for TSM -- another LCS championship and another Worlds appearance. Unfortunately for TSM, it was another underwhelming 9th-11th place finish at the world championship.

2018

After many years of being one of the best North American League of Legends teams, TSM had a poor 2018 by their standards. Doublelift was gone again, and the team missed out on both MSI and Worlds. TSM stumbled in the playoffs in both spring and summer and failed to reach a playoffs final for the first time. This also was the first time TSM missed out on Worlds after qualifying seven straight years.

2019

TSM were a little better in 2019 than 2018. They reached a final again but finished second to Team Liquid and Doublelift in the spring final. In the summer, TSM finished 5th-6th in the playoffs and second at the regional finals to miss out on Worlds for the second straight year.

2020

This year started off much the same way as the previous two years, with TSM finishing fourth in the spring playoffs. Doublelift returned for the summer split, and finished fourth in the split but leveled up in the playoffs to capture another LCS championship. With Doublelift and Bjergsen reunited and young star Mingyi ""Spica"" Lu as their jungler, TSM returned to Worlds with high expectations. However, the team would infamously go 0-6 in the group stage for another disappointing 13th-16th finish.

2021

This year was the beginning of the end for TSM as one of the standout League of Legends teams in North America. Doublelift retired and would not return to TSM, and Bjergsen retired as a player and became the team’s coach. The team finished third in the Mid-Season Showdown (aka the spring playoffs) and fourth at the LCS Championship (aka summer playoffs). The team did not qualify for either MSI or Worlds.

2022

After a year as coach, Bjergsen left TSM and joined Team Liquid as a player. It was a shocking move as Bjergsen had become synonymous with TSM after spending eight years with the organization -- an eternity in esports. For the first time in their history, TSM didn’t make a split playoffs, and summer was not much better. With a ninth-place finish in the spring, TSM had hit rock bottom. Even worse for the org, a scathing report from the Washington Post described a toxic work environment and “culture of fear” that had been fostered by owner Reginald for many years.

2023

TSM again failed to make the playoffs in the spring. Rumors began circulating that the organization might be looking to sell its LCS spot and perhaps try to acquire a spot in another region. The team didn’t do much better in the summer and finished 7th-8th in the playoffs.

North American esports organisation TSM has announced a multi-year partnership with sandwich chain Jersey Mike’s.

As part of the deal, Jersey Mike’s has been named the official Sub Sandwich of the organisation.

Moreover, the two parties will work together on branding and content production in order to provide fans with a suite of offerings. Specifically, TSM and Jersey Mike’s will offer fans sweepstakes for prizes, as well as launch a ‘Subs for Subs’ initiative.

Throughout the campaign, Jersey Mike’s will gift thousands of subscriptions and free subs to up-and-coming Twitch streamers to grow their audiences and help them become full-time content creators. Last but not least, a custom-crafted Jersey Mike’s Blitz Arena will be added to TSM’s esports coaching app Blitz.

In addition, this collaboration will also fund a first-of-its-kind internship programme. Students from TSM partner campuses, Jersey Mike’s university partners and HBCUs will have the opportunity for hands-on experience in esports business, including working at an esports-focused event.

This isn’t the first esports-related partnership that Jersey Mike’s has managed to secure. The sandwich chain first entered the industry in 2018, when it sponsored Riot Games‘ North American League of Legends Championship Series (LCS).

Esports Insider has teamed up with the University of Warwick for ESI Next Gen. To find out more, click here.

Stephan Cieplik, Chief Revenue Officer at TSM, commented on the partnership: “This partnership stands for everything our fans crave- and it will leave them hungry for more!

“Jersey Mike’s commitment to quality and excellence aligns with our own values at TSM, and we look forward to bringing this partnership to life with authentic activations to engage with our fans, gamers and streamers.”

The TSM and Jersey Mike’s collaboration is one of the first projects that Cieplik has spearheaded since joining the organisation at the start of December 2022.","(tsm, service provider, twitch)

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Despite the collapse of FTX and a scrapped $210 million naming rights deal, Team SoloMid’s affinity for crypto hasn’t soured. In fact, the esports org also known as TSM is now building its own crypto sub-network on Avalanche to facilitate esports transactions and tournaments, TSM parent company Swift announced Tuesday.

Swift, which also owns the Blitz Esports platform, is building the blockchain sub-network—or “Subnet”—on Avalanche for TSM events. Swift has also chosen crypto payments firm Core for TSM and Blitz, allowing players and fans to “store, sell, and purchase digital assets,” according to a statement. When asked if those assets might be NFTs, Ava Labs’ Head of Gaming Ed Chang explained to Decrypt via email that such details have not yet been finalized.

The Blitz Subnet will use Avalanche’s AVAX token for network transaction fees, also known as gas fees. Swift plans to convert its Avalanche Subnet into an “Elastic Subnet” in the future, meaning that users will be able to become validators for the network by locking up or “staking” crypto tokens and will earn financial rewards in exchange under the “proof of stake” validation mechanism.

“Web3 gaming is still quite early,” TSM and Swift CEO Andy Dinh told Decrypt via email. “It’s very exciting, but it will take time to materialize.”

As one of the largest esports orgs, TSM is known for its “League of Legends” (LoL) professional team, while Blitz offers in-game overlays for LoL as well as for AAA games like “Apex Legends,” “Valorant,” and “Teamfight Tactics” and currently boasts over 30 million users.

“Partnering with TSM brings truly innovative gaming experiences to players around the world,” said John Wu, president of Ava Labs, the developers behind Avalanche. “Avalanche’s fully customizable subnets were created to help organizations push the boundaries of what is possible for gaming with sub-second transaction speed, scalability, and security for millions of users.”

When asked why TSM chose Avalanche over other blockchain networks, Dinh explained that Ava Labs was the most collaborative.

“We think a big part of finding success is finding teams that are easy to work with,” Dinh said.

TSM’s approach to Web3 involves building products over time that are “authentic to the space and add value,” Dinh added.","(technology, r&d participant, ava labs)

"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) is navigating a fiercely competitive chip industry. However, the company’s prospects remain uplifted amid the competition between the United States and China for tech supremacy.

TSM unveiled its N2 Prototype this year, which is expected to provide up to 10% higher performance and 30% lower power consumption than the company’s existing 5 nm process. This advanced semiconductor technology is set to enter volume production in 2025 and could be a game-changer for the company.

Moreover, auto industry giant Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) is on track to adopt TSM’s 3nm chips in 2024, underpinning a growing demand for the company’s chips. As TSLA joins TSM’s N3P customer list, reflecting a strategic win for both companies, the chip company’s revenue growth trajectory should receive a boost.

TSM’s stock closed the last trading session at $104.45, higher than the 50-day moving average of $96.08 and 200-day moving average of $93.94, underscoring a strong momentum in its stock prices.

Under such circumstances, TSM’s prospects appear bright, which should make the stock appealing to potential investors. Let’s look at the trends of its key financial metrics to gain further insight.

Analyzing Financial Performance and Market Trends of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited

The following are the trends and fluctuations of the trailing-12-month revenue of TSM:

As of December 2020, TSM reported a revenue of $46.99 billion, which slightly increased to $48.17 billion within the same month.

In the first quarter of 2021 (March 31), there was a minor increase in revenue to $49.68 billion. The trend continued upwards throughout the entire year of 2021, with revenue standing at $52.25 billion (June), $54.34 billion (September), and a slightly higher growth rate toward the end of the year as it hit $56.69 billion in December.

The year 2022 showed significant strides in growth. Starting with a revenue figure of $58.17 billion in March, a leap to $62.6 billion by the end of June, and another slight increase to $64.89 billion in September. This rapid growth rate intensified in December, when the revenue ascended to $75.21 billion, marking the highest record in this period.

However, in 2023, a downward trend became apparent, starting at $74.15 billion in March, further dropping to $71.21 billion in June, and finishing the third quarter at $66.66 billion in September.

In summary, TSM’s financial trends show a positive growth rate from December 2020 until December 2022, followed by a downturn heading into 2023. From the initial value in December 2020 to the last recorded value in September 2023, revenue demonstrated a notable growth rate, albeit with some levels of volatility.

The trend of the gross margin for TSM has generally been increasing over the course of the data provided. Here are significant observations:

In December 2020, the gross margin stood at 53.1%.

By the end of March 2021, there was a slight increase to 53.2%, but this trend did not continue in the subsequent quarters, with a drop to 52.4% in June 2021 and a further decline to 51.9% in September 2021.

The lowest point was reached in December 2021, where the gross margin fell to 51.6%.

However, from the start of 2022, TSM experienced consistent growth in gross margin. It rose to 52.6% in March 2022, 55% in June 2022 and then 57.3% by September 2022.

The peak was witnessed at the end of 2022, reaching 59.6%.

In 2023, although the margin slightly increased to 59.7% in March, it experienced a decline in the following months, falling to 58.6% in June and then 57% in September.

In summary, the gross margin for TSM fluctuated over time but saw a net overall growth of approximately 4.9% between December 2020 and September 2023.

The trend and fluctuations in the Return on Sales (ROS) of TSM are as follows:

Starting from the end of December 2020, TSM’s ROS was reported at 0.44.

There was a consistent value of 0.44 till March 2021.

A slight decrease was observed in the subsequent quarters, with 0.43 in June 2021 and further decreasing to 0.42 in September and December 2021.

The first quarter of 2022 saw an uptick in the ROS back to 0.43, indicating the beginning of an upward trend.

The steady quarterly increase continued through the rest of 2022. From 0.46 in June, culminating at 0.51 by the end of the year in December 2022.

However, the upward journey was short-lived; in 2023, a clear downward trend commenced. A slightly diminished ROS of 0.50 was reported in June 2023, further dropping to 0.49 by the end of September 2023.

Calculating the growth rate from the values of the last (September 2023 – 0.49) and the first (December 2020 – 0.44), we can see an overall increase of approximately 11% over the period under consideration.

It is important to put greater emphasis on the more recent data. Notably, the last three quarters (from January 2023 to September 2023) have seen a steady downward trend from 0.51 to 0.49. This contrasts with the strong upward trend seen throughout 2022.

Summary of current ratio Trends for TSM:

TSM’s current ratio recorded a significant increase over the observed period, growing from 1.73 as of December 31, 2020, to 2.15 by the end of the third quarter in 2023.

The growth rate of the current ratio, measured by the change in the last value compared to the first, indicates a significant growth of approximately 24.28%.

Throughout the period, there have been fluctuations in the current ratio. Specifically, in the first quarter of each year, slight dips have been observed, followed by increases in the second quarter.

Despite these fluctuations, a consistent overall upward trend has emerged. The peak was reached in the third quarter of 2022 when the current ratio hit 2.49.

Greater emphasis on more recent data reveals that for most of 2023, the current ratio has been above 2. Noteworthy is the drop from 2.42 in June 2023 to 2.15 in September 2023, a quarterly decrease of 11.23%, illustrating the volatility of this ratio.

In summary, TSM has shown an overall upward trend in the current ratio over the historical period, indicating an improving liquidity condition.

Analyzing Taiwan Semiconductor’s Share Price Volatility: June – December 2023

Based on the data provided, the share price of TSM underwent a varying trend between June 2023 and December 2023:

At the beginning of this period, on June 30, 2023, the price was $101.13.

The share price slightly declined to $101.10 by July 7, 2023, but rose to $103.11 by July 14, 2023. From then, a clear decelerating trend was observed until August 18, 2023, when the share price fell to $91.82.

Thereafter, there was a slight increase to $94.21 by September 1, 2023, after which the price again decreased to its lowest point of $85.75 on September 29, 2023.

Subsequently, there was a gradual and almost consistent rise in the share price, reaching as high as $102.63 on December 22, 2023.

The year ended on a high note, with the share price of TSM reaching its peak at $104.45 on December 26, 2023.

In general, the growth rate of TSM’s share price initially decreased from June 2023 to September 2023. However, from September 2023, an accelerating upward trend was observed that continued through the end of the year. Here is a chart of TSM’s price over the past 180 days.

Analyzing the Momentum, Quality, and Sentiment Ratings of TSM in 2023

Based on the provided data, TSM, a stock in the 91-stock Semiconductor & Wireless Chip category, has shown fluctuations in its POWR Ratings grade over several months from July to December of 2023. Here are some key observations:

Throughout most of July and August 2023, TSM maintained a grade of B (Buy). However, it did witness a temporary decline to C (Neutral) near the end of July, which continued until mid-August.

The stock recovered its B (Buy) grade by August 19, 2023, improving its rank within the category from #32 to #20.

TSM’s performances stayed steady through most of September 2023, with an occasional dip in performance to C (Neutral) on one week of September 23.

From late September through the rest of the year, TSM sustained a consistent B (Buy) grade, showing a good standing within its category.

TSM’s ranking within its category mostly hovered between #15 and #21. In the final month of 2023, TSM showed strong performance within its category.

As of the last available record, dated December 27, 2023, TSM held a B (Buy) POWR grade and was ranked #16 in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip category.

Over the duration from June 2023 to December 2023, TSM has performed quite distinctively across various dimensions of the POWR Ratings. Focusing on the three most noteworthy dimensions, namely Momentum, Quality and Sentiment, we have found some interesting patterns.

Momentum: This dimension consistently scored extremely high for TSM. Starting with a value of 99 in June 2023, the rating remained steady almost throughout the year, suffering only a slight dip to 98 from August to December 2023.

Quality: Quality started at 97 in June 2023, maintaining this score until July of the same year. This slightly decreased to 94 in August 2023, with a subtle shift upward to 95 by November 2023. It maintained this level through December of the year.

Sentiment: The Sentiment rating exhibited the most fluctuation among the significant dimensions. Starting strong with a value of 90 in June 2023, the sentiment rating dropped to 81 by July and maintained that score until August. The rating bounced between 76 and 79 from September to October, then steeply increased to 96 in November and continued to rise to 97 by December.

Through examination of these three dimensions, it’s clear that TSM maintained an exceptional Momentum profile and quite a stable Quality rating throughout the six months built into our data set. On the other hand, Sentiment toward the company seemed more variable throughout the period.

"Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) took a beating Thursday as the world's largest contract chipmaker topped analyst estimates for the second quarter but disappointed with its outlook. TSM stock fell more than 5% and dragged other chip players down with it.

X

Taiwan Semiconductor, better known as TSMC, earned $1.14 per U.S. share on sales of $15.68 billion in the June quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $1.07 a share on sales of $15.44 billion. However, TSMC earnings fell 25% year over year while sales dropped 12%. In local currency, earnings decreased 23% while sales declined 10%.

TSMC's results marked its second straight quarter of declining sales and earnings as its customers navigate a downturn in chip demand.

For the current quarter, TSMC predicted revenue of $16.7 billion to $17.5 billion. The midpoint of $17.1 billion is below Wall Street's target of $17.4 billion. In the year-earlier period, TSMC generated $19.2 billion in sales.

TSM Stock Falls After Report

Taiwan Semiconductor also cut its revenue forecast for the full year to a 10% decline from a mid-single-digit decline.

""This is the third cut to its revenue outlook that TSMC has made this cycle,"" Needham analyst Charles Shi said in a note to clients. Shi had expected TSMC to reduce its 2023 sales outlook to a high-single-digit decline.

""TSMC's second-quarter earnings call may go down as one of the more pessimistic calls in recent history,"" Shi said.

On the stock market today, TSM stock tumbled 5.1% to close at 97.86.

TSMC's earnings report pulled down a host of semiconductor stocks. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, known as SOX, sank 3.6% on Thursday. The SOX includes the 30 largest semiconductor stocks traded in the U.S.

Among major TSMC customers, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 5.3% and Nvidia (NVDA) retreated 3.3%.

TSM stock is in a flat base with a buy point of 110.69, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.

Factors Behind Soft Demand

""Our second-quarter business was impacted by the overall global economic conditions, which dampened the end-market demand, and led to customers' ongoing inventory adjustment,"" Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said in a news release.

He added, ""Moving into third quarter 2023, we expect our business to be supported by the strong ramp of our 3-nanomenter technologies, partially offset by customers' continued inventory adjustment.""

Circuit widths on chips are measured in nanometers, which are one-billionth of a meter.

The slower-than-expected economic recovery in China also is a factor in TSMC's reduced outlook, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said in a report.

In addition, the chip inventory correction now is likely to last through the fourth quarter, rather than the third quarter as previously expected, Muse said.

Taiwan Semi Getting AI Boost

Taiwan Semiconductor produces chips for fabless semiconductor firms such as AMD, Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM).

Cyclical headwinds overshadowed strength in AI chip production at TSMC in the second quarter, Needham's Shi said.

TSMC management expects chips for artificial intelligence to grow to a low-teens percent of sales by 2028 from 6% today.

""Management still sees Q3 as the end of an inventory correction but believes customers may not build inventory back as fast as previously expected,"" Shi said.

TSM Stock On Tech Leaders List

Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson kept his outperform rating on TSM stock despite the company's disappointing outlook.

""While we believe this deterioration in outlook wasn't unexpected, the magnitude of the downtick was more significant than we had anticipated heading into earnings,"" Bryson said in a note to clients.

TSM stock ranks sixth out of 30 stocks in IBD's semiconductor manufacturing industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. Taiwan Semiconductor has an IBD Composite Rating of 92 out of 99. IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

Further, TSM stock is on the IBD Tech Leaders list.

"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?

Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about TSMC (TSM).

TSMC currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.43, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by seven brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.43 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

Of the seven recommendations that derive the current ABR, five are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 71.4% and 14.3% of all recommendations.

Brokerage Recommendation Trends for TSM

Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for TSM





Check price target & stock forecast for TSMC here>>>



The ABR suggests buying TSMC, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.

Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.

This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.

Story continues

Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.

ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank

In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.

Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.

It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.

In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.

In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.

There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.

Should You Invest in TSM?

Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for TSMC, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.97.

Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for TSMC. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for TSMC.

North American esports organisation TSM is set to pull out of ‘several’ titles, and is considering selling its League of Legends LCS slot, according to a report by Sports Business Journal.

In a subsequent post on Twitter, TSM’s CEO Andy ‘Reginald’ Dinh did not deny the report, though highlighted TSM is ‘committed to esports’ and is still planning on entering CS:GO.

Sports Business Journal reported that TSM was considering selling its slot in North America’s franchised LCS league, which it has competed in since the league’s creation in 2013.

Following the report, TSM’s CEO Dinh reassured fans via Twitter that TSM was committed to esports, though did not deny the reported claims and argued the organisation’s pending entry into CS:GO was more important than its departures.

“We’re planning to enter CS:GO sometime later this year which is a larger investment than all of the games we’ve left combined,” Dinh said in the tweet. “TSM is always evaluating what esports ecosystems are best to invest in and will continue to enter & exit games.”

TSM — which in 2022 Forbes ranked as the most valuable esports organisation at $540m (~£437m) — has been going through a turbulent period after several high-profile departures in recent months, including its COO Walter Wang. Dinh said in a recent Reddit thread that TSM had “overhired and expanded too quickly” and was “in the process of figuring multiple things out.”

It comes after TSM was forced to cancel its iconic $210m (~£148) naming rights partnership with crypto exchange FTX following the exchange’s high profile collapse in November 2022.

TSM said at the time it’d use the money from that sponsorship to expand its presence in mobile esports, and widen its reach via new offices in Asia, Europe, and South America.

TSM put out a statement insisting it was “strong, profitable and stable” following the cancellation. Sources told Sports Business Journal in its report that the cancellation of the FTX deal was a big financial hit.

The esports organisation currently competes in League of Legends, VALORANT, Dota2, Apex Legends and Fortnite, amongst others.

A potential move into CS:GO for TSM would come just as Valve’s anticipated Counter-Strike 2 update reignites conversation around the popularity of the game. Meanwhile, the LCS has suffered from declining viewership in recent years.",,"{""SECTOR"": [""Technology"", """"]}","{""title"": ""TSM reportedly pulling out of several titles, may sell LCS slot"", ""publisher"": ""Esports Insider"", ""authors"": ""Jake Nordland"", ""published_date"": ""2023-04-03""}"
"The semiconductor industry is set to benefit from the exponential growth of the AI chip market. The widespread adoption of cloud-based AI solutions drives the demand for appropriate semiconductor chips.

While both Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) are positioned to benefit from the industry tailwinds, TSM’s recent technological advancements and financial performance metrics could help the stock generate higher returns.

The potential and benefits of AI have prompted numerous businesses, including startups, to enter the AI chips market. As a result, the artificial intelligence (AI) chips market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 61.5% by 2027.

TSM has gained marginally intraday, while AMD declined 1.4%. However, TSM’s 3.8% gains over the past nine months are lower than AMD’s 46.9% returns.

Here are the reasons I think TSM could perform better in the near term:

Recent Developments

During the 2023 North America Technology Symposium, TSM unveiled its latest technological advancements, demonstrating its commitment to innovation. Among the highlights were significant developments in 2nm technology and the introduction of new members to its highly regarded 3nm technology lineup. These additions cater to a wide range of customer needs, providing tailored processes for enhanced power, performance, and density.

On April 21, TSM signed a 20,000 GWh renewable energy joint procurement contract with ARK Power (a subsidiary of ARK Solar Energy). The agreement enables TSM suppliers and subsidiaries to purchase renewable energy and assists with electricity evaluation and planning services.

Alternatively, on May 24, AMD announced the launch of the AMD Radeon™ RX 7600 graphics card, optimized to provide next-generation, high-performance 1080p gaming, streaming, and content creation with stunning visual fidelity.

Recent Financial Results

TSM’s net revenue increased 3.6% year-over-year to NT$508.63 billion ($16.57 billion) in the first quarter that ended March 31, 2023. Its gross profit rose 4.9% from the prior year’s quarter to NT$286.50 billion ($9.33 billion), while income from operations came in at NT$231.24 billion ($7.54 billion), up 3.3% year-over-year.

In addition, the company’s net income and EPS increased 2.1% year-over-year to NT$206.99 billion ($6.74 million) and NT$7.98, respectively.

On the other side, during the fiscal first quarter that ended April 1, 2023, AMD’s net revenue decreased 9.1% year-over-year to $5.35 billion. Its non-GAAP gross profit declined 13.7% year-over-year to $2.68 billion. Its non-GAAP operating expenses rose 17.9% from the prior-year quarter to $1.59 billion, while non-GAAP operating income declined 40.2% year-over-year to $1.10 billion.

Moreover, AMD’s non-GAAP net income and EPS decreased 39% and 46.9% year-over-year to $970 million and $0.60, respectively.

Past and Expected Financial Performance

TSM’s revenue and EPS grew at CAGRs of 28.9% and 87.8%, respectively, over the past three years. Analysts expect TSM’s revenue to increase 25.6% next year. The company’s EPS is expected to grow 24% next year.

On the other hand, AMD’s revenue grew at a CAGR of 47.1%, while EPS declined at a CAGR of 17.7% over the past three years. Analysts expect the company’s EPS to increase 44.7% next year. The company’s revenue is expected to grow 18.1% next year.

Profitability

TSM is more profitable, with a gross profit margin and net income margin of 59.68% and 44.74%, compared to AMD’s 50.77% and 1.71%, respectively.

Furthermore, TSM’s ROE, ROA, and ROTC of 37.86%, 19.80%, and 20.23% compare to AMD’s 0.72%, 0.18%, and 0.58%, respectively.

Valuation

In terms of forward non-GAAP P/E, AMD is currently trading at 40.90x, higher than TSM’s 19.41x. Moreover, AMD’s forward EV/Sales multiple of 8.13 is slightly higher than TSM’s 6.38.

POWR Ratings

TSM has an overall rating of B, which equates to a Buy in our proprietary POWR Ratings system. Conversely, AMD has an overall rating of D, translating to a Sell. The POWR Ratings are calculated considering 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.

Our proprietary rating system also evaluates each stock based on eight distinct categories. TSM has a grade of A for Quality. Its trailing-12-month EBIT and net income margins of 49.47% and 44.74% are remarkably higher than the industry average of 4.35% and 2.01%, respectively.

AMD, on the other hand, has a grade of D for Quality. Its trailing-12-month EBIT and net income margins of 0.73% and 1.71% are lower than the industry average of 4.35% and 2.01%, respectively.

In the 91-stock Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry, TSM is ranked #26, while AMD is ranked #85.

Beyond what we’ve stated above, we have also rated both stocks for Growth, Stability, Momentum, Value, and Sentiment. Click here to view TSM ratings. Get all AMD ratings here.

The Winner

The outlook for the U.S. semiconductor industry looks promising, which should benefit both TSM and AMD.

However, AMD’s relatively weak recent quarter financial results raise concerns about its future prospects, making its competitor TSM the better buy now.

"Shopify is making a big investment in franchised esports, buying the slot in League of Legends’ North American circuit currently held by TSM. Canada-based Shopify launched an in-house competitive gaming team, Shopify Rebellion, in 2021, as company co-founder and CEO Tobias ""Tobi"" Lütke has long been an esports fan. Sources tell SBJ that TSM has been looking to offload its franchise slot in Riot Games’ LCS circuit since June. Terms of the deal were not available at press time. Shopify Rebellion also plays competitively in Starcraft II, Rocket League, Valorant, and others.

However, this may not be the end of League of Legends for North American Esports organization TSM as sources tell SBJ they may be looking to acquire another League of Legends team based in Asia to participate in League of Legends Champions Korea or League of Legends Pro League (China).

Shopify also made another move, piggybacking off their LCS announcment, revealing that they have partnered with Moist Esports to run a Valorant team as part of a joint effort.

Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $18.99 billion, down 4.71% from the prior-year quarter.

Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.97 per share and revenue of $66.45 billion. These totals would mark changes of -24.35% and -12.42%, respectively, from last year.

Any recent changes to analyst estimates for TSMC should also be noted by investors. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.

North American esports organisation TSM has announced it will leave the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS), NA’s top League of Legends competition.

Rather than taking a step back from League of Legends, the organisation has unveiled plans to move to another tier-one region.

According to an announcement made on May 20th, TSM CEO Andy ‘Reginald’ Dinh said the switch to another region aligns with the organisation’s goal to do “whatever it takes” to win a World Championship.

The decision to move regions follows a report by Sports Business Journal claiming TSM is preparing to pull out of ‘several’ titles it fields rosters in. In addition to League of Legends, the organisation competes in a range of titles including Apex Legends, Dota 2 and VALORANT.

Dinh did not specify which region TSM would move to, but some, like esports journalist Jacob Wolf, believe the organisation may intend to move to China’s League of Legends Pro League (LPL). Esports Insider has contacted TSM for comment.

Domestically, TSM often competed towards the top of the table and was in regular contention for tournament victories, but on the international stage it struggled to achieve success against other regions.

Despite reports of TSM reducing its esports presence, the organisation continues to secure partners. In recent months, the organisation has partnered with sandwich chain Jersey Mike’s and blockchain platform Avalanche.

Dinh spoke on TSM’s decision to leave the LCS: “Since the beginning, TSM has always been about competing at the highest level.

“We have made a tough decision to start the process of transitioning to another tier-one region. This may feel sudden but, to be honest, we’ve been actively working toward this for the last three years.”",,"{""SECTOR"": [""Technology"", """"]}","{""title"": ""TSM confirms LCS departure, plans to join another region"", ""publisher"": ""Esports Insider"", ""authors"": ""Jonno Nicholson"", ""published_date"": ""2023-05-22""}"

North American esports organisation TSM has sold its League of Legends LCS franchise slot to Shopify Rebellion, ending its over decade-long tenure in North America’s top-tier.

TSM’s League of Legends roster will compete under the Shopify Rebellion banner for the 2024 season. Details such as potential roster changes and the price of the franchise slot were not disclosed.

Shopify Rebellion is the North American esports brand of ecommerce platform Shopify and has competed in a wide array of games since its launch in 2021. This includes VALORANT, StarCraft, Dota 2, Halo, Street Fighter 6 and Rocket League.

Its Dota 2 division is set to compete at this year’s The International. Meanwhile, on the same day as its LCS purchase, the organisation secured a joint-venture VALORANT partnership with Moist Esports.

It has been publicly known throughout the year that TSM, one of the LCS’ inaugural organisations, was looking to sell its franchise spot. The organisation even confirmed its LCS departure in May this year, highlighting its intention to join another league in 2024. This is rumoured to be China’s LPL.

Dario ’TLO’ Wünsch, Shopify’s Esports Program Development Lead, commented on its new LCS venture: “Entering League of Legends – one of the largest esports titles, with a rich competitive history – felt like an obvious next step for us as we continue to grow our presence in esports.

“We’re excited to work with the former TSM roster and for them to compete in the LCS under the Shopify Rebellion banner.”

North America’s tier-one League of Legends competition has undergone a tumultuous period in 2023, with declining viewership and the LCS at one point being postponed due to a player walk-out vote. In terms of viewership, the competition’s recent LCS Summer Split was the least popular split in the league’s modern history.

This year’s LCS saw a new franchise enter the competition, with CLG being acquired by North American organisation NRG in April. Interestingly, NRG later went on to win the 2023 LCS Summer Split.",,"{""SECTOR"": [""Technology"", """"]}","{""title"": ""TSM sells LCS franchise to Shopify Rebellion"", ""publisher"": ""Esports Insider"", ""authors"": ""Tom Daniels"", ""published_date"": ""2023-09-20""}"

North American esports organisation TSM has secured a partnership with blockchain platform Avalanche for TSM’s competitive gaming platform Blitz.

The major partnership will see Blitz use Core, Avalanche’s payment system, to power all user payments.

The partnership includes both the overarching TSM brand, as well as its sub-brand Blitz, which will also benefit from the connection to blockchain. As a result, TSM and Avalanche will work together on activations for fans, players, and creators.

Blitz will get its own Subnet on the Avalanche blockchain, meaning that TSM will essentially get a custom blockchain to facilitate its needs. The two companies announced that TSM will host tournaments on the Blitz Subnet, and also create ‘Blitz Arenas’ that will offer prizes for players competing in them.

Avalanche will become the official blockchain partner for TSM going forwards, but the two parties did not disclose financial details.

A previous TSM partner within the blockchain space was FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange that notably signed a naming rights deal in 2021. However, after a myriad of controversies from the cryptocurrency company, TSM suspended and later cancelled its deal with FTX in 2022.

Esports Insider has teamed up with the University of Warwick for ESI Next Gen. To find out more, click here.

Andy Dinh, founder and CEO of TSM and Blitz, commented on the partnership: “They are an authentic leader in this space, and together we share a long-term vision of building products that are authentic and beneficial to our community.”

"Shopify is entering the League of Legends arena. On Wednesday, Shopify announced that its Rebellion esports brand will be acquiring TSM’s spot in the League Championship Series (LCS), the pro circuit for US League of Legends esports.

The move marks a major change of the guard in the LCS. TSM, one of the biggest esports organizations in the world, got its start as a scrappy League of Legends team; the TSM acronym stands for Team SoloMid, which references a solo League of Legends player occupying the middle lane of the game’s multi-pronged map. In the mid 2010s, TSM was one of the most successful teams in the LCS, and the organization has entered other esports, signed Twitch streamers, and even bought an esports app.

But TSM has had some struggles as of late. Its LCS team hasn’t been quite as successful in League (outside of an impressive run in 2020). TSM CEO and founder Andy Dinh was fined and placed on a two-year probation by League of Legends developer Riot Games after an investigation found that “there was a pattern and practice of disparaging and bullying behavior exhibited by Dinh” toward TSM staff and players. The organization was forced to back out of a $210 million deal with FTX after the crypto company collapsed.

Then, in March, Sports Business Journal reported that TSM was considering dumping its LCS team, and in May, TSM announced that it was looking to sell its LCS spot and compete in League of Legends in another region. “I believe moving to another region will re-ignite our hunger to do whatever it takes to win a world championship,” Dinh said in a video about the change.

Shopify Rebellion will compete in the LCS starting in 2024. “Entering League of Legends — one of the largest esports titles, with a rich competitive history — felt like an obvious next step for us as we continue to grow our presence in esports,” Shopify Rebellion’s Dario “TLO” Wünsch said in a statement. The organization also competes in games like Dota 2, Valorant, and Rocket League.

TSM hasn’t said where it may end up fielding a League of Legends team next. But the organization is already positioning itself as a global brand. “TSM is a movement, binding us all together no matter who we are or where we came from,” TSM wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). “From North America and Europe to South America and Asia, our hearts beat as one.”","(esports, primary operator, tsm)

"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?

Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about TSMC (TSM) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.

TSMC currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.43, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by seven brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.43 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

Of the seven recommendations that derive the current ABR, five are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 71.4% and 14.3% of all recommendations.

Brokerage Recommendation Trends for TSM

The ABR suggests buying TSMC, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.

Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.

In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.

Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR

In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.

The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.

It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.

In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.

In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.

Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.

Should You Invest in TSM?

In terms of earnings estimate revisions for TSMC, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.97.

Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for TSMC. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for TSMC.

For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates project earnings of $4.97 per share and a revenue of $66.45 billion, demonstrating changes of -24.35% and -12.42%, respectively, from the preceding year.

Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for TSMC. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. Consequently, upward revisions in estimates express analysts' positivity towards the company's business operations and its ability to generate profits.

Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.

The Zacks Rank system, ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), possesses a remarkable history of outdoing, externally audited, with #1 stocks returning an average annual gain of +25% since 1988.

Although officially launched in 2020, EPOS was formerly known as Sennheiser Communications, a joint venture between audio brand Sennheiser and hearing aid brand Demant. After the joint venture ceased to exist, EPOS was created as a standalone brand in the Demant roster of companies.

Australian esports organisation Team Bliss has announced the acquisition of fellow Australian organisation The Chiefs Esports Club.

The two companies will merge but continue to operate as independent brands going forward, keeping both the Team Bliss and The Chiefs names alive. Australian esports industry insider Chris Smith will also take on an advisory role during the merger.

The two companies noted that the merger has been in the works for a while, and that they had built a relationship over the past 12 months. Bliss and Chiefs notably worked together with Logitech G on the launch of the new Logitech G Pro X2 headset. No decisions have been made regarding future teams or titles to compete in, they said.

Ukrainian footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko, currently playing for Premier League club Arsenal, has created a new esports organisation called Passion UA alongside former NAVI coach MykhailoBlahin.

The organisation will debut with a CS:GO roster that will soon start competing at regional and international events. The team consists of five Ukrainian players aged between 16 and 18.

Zinchenko announced the launch of the new organisation with a letter to fans published on the Passion UA’s website. He noted that a project such as this was a dream of his for a long time, and that he wishes for the company to redefine the way fans experience and engage with competitive gaming.",,"{""SECTOR"": [""Technology"", """"]}","{""title"": ""Esports investment report, September 2023: TSM, BLAST, Bliss"", ""publisher"": ""Esports Insider"", ""authors"": ""Ivan Šimić"", ""published_date"": ""2023-10-03""}"

League of Legends (LoL) mainstay TSM have ended their 12-year saga in the LoL Championship Series (LCS) after they sold their spot in the league to Shopify Rebellion for a reported US$10 million, the North America LCS franchising fee required by Riot Games.

Shopify Rebellion first revealed the acquisition to the public on 21 September (Wednesday), revealing they will also absorb TSM’s former LoL roster and will be joining the LCS for the 2024 season.

“Entering League of Legends – one of the largest esports titles, with a rich competitive history –felt like an obvious next step for us, as we continue to grow our presence in Esports,” Dario “TLO” Wünsch, Shopify Rebellion's esports program development lead, said in a statement.

TSM CEO and founder Andy “Reginald” Dinh described the acquisition as a “milestone moment for TSM and the entire esports community.” Reginald added that he feels combining TSM's ""relentless pursuit of victory"" with Shopify Rebellion's ""innovative spirit"" will spark new success and enhance the competitive landscape of esports.

“We are excited to welcome Shopify Rebellion to the LCS and the greater Riot esports ecosystem, with their teams now represented in LoL esports and VALORANT,” Carlos Antunes, Head of LoL Esports Americas, added.

Antunes also said that Riot recognises TSM’s contributions to the LCS, and that “their legacy will continue to be felt within our community for many years to come”

Why did TSM the LCS?

Earlier this year, TSM announced their plans to depart the LCS, a plan that was purportedly first brought up in 2022.

Story continues

TSM are one of the original organisations that were franchised in the league and have earned seven regional championships during their time there.

They also qualified for the LoL World Championship seven times and were present in the first Worlds tournament in 2011, where the team took third place.

However, despite being the winningest team in the region, TSM had not put up strong showings in the past couple of years. TSM’s last Worlds showing was in 2020, where they were eliminated in the Group Stage in 13th-16th place.

According to Reginald’s video message released in May, the organisation had been working on the decision to leave the LCS “for the last three years.”

“TSM has always been about delivering at the highest level, and every time we’ve gone to Worlds, we’ve failed to deliver a trophy, and what that really means is the job is not finished,” said Reginald.

“I believe moving to another region will re-ignite our hunger to doing whatever it takes to win the World Championship.""

TSM have been one of the most storied esports organisations in the United States, but they have been bathed in controversy for the last couple of years, mostly because of management. The organisation’s CEO was previously investigated for misconduct and was notorious for bullying employees and players.

Reginald was placed on probation for two years “across the Riot ecosystem"" and ordered to ""complete sensitivity training and executive training,"" in addition to the US$75,000 fine levied against TSM.

In 2022, ex-TSM coach Zhang “Peter Zhang” Yi was permabanned from Riot due to misappropriation of funds, including player salaries.

Later, in November of the same year, the collapse of crypto exchange company FTX also impacted the organisation because it was a naming sponsor of TSM for a short time. As a result, TSM suspended their US $210 million partnership with FTX.

Earlier this year, the organisation had also been reportedly downsizing, with Reginald explaining on Reddit that TSM had “over-hired and expanded too quickly”.

Sports Business Journal also first reported that the company was pausing esports efforts and investments.

TSM have yet to reveal which tier 1 LoL league the organisation will join.

"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), better known as TSMC, reported better-than-expected sales for October, thanks to demand for chips for artificial intelligence and Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 15. TSM stock jumped on the news Friday.

X

On the stock market today, TSM stock surged 6.4% higher to close at 97.44. Other semiconductor stocks followed suit.

Early Friday, TSMC released its monthly sales data, which showed a 34.8% increase in revenue in October from September. On a year-over-year basis, TSMC's October sales rose 15.7%.

The October report sets a positive tone for the company's fourth quarter, Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson said in a client note. Bryson reiterated his outperform rating on TSM stock after the sales report.

""We expect a strong Q4 from TSMC,"" he said. ""In particular, we expect that Apple seasonality and continued growth in demand for AI solutions will boost TSMC into year end, with some potential benefit from recently better handset dynamics.""

"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), the world's largest contract chipmaker, on Thursday beat analyst estimates for the third quarter. TSM stock rose on the news.

X

The company, better known as TSMC, earned $1.29 per U.S. share on sales of $17.28 billion in the September quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $1.16 a share on sales of $16.97 billion. However, TSMC earnings fell 24% year over year while sales dropped 10%.

TSMC's results marked its third straight quarter of declining sales and earnings as its customers navigate a downturn in chip demand. TSMC's customers include Apple (AAPL), AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Qualcomm (QCOM) and more.

For the current quarter, TSMC predicted revenue of $18.8 billion to $19.6 billion. The midpoint of $19.2 billion is above Wall Street's target of $18.54 billion. In the fourth quarter last year, TSMC generated $20.54 billion in sales.

TSM Stock Rises After Report

On the stock market today, TSM stock climbed 3.7% to close at 92.91.

""Our third-quarter business was supported by the strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology and higher demand for 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by customers' ongoing inventory adjustment,"" Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said in a news release. Circuit widths on chips are measured in nanometers, which are one-billionth of a meter.

He added, ""Moving into fourth quarter 2023, we expect our business to be supported by the continued strong ramp of our 3-nanomenter technology, partially offset by customers' continued inventory adjustment.""

TSMC Close To Next Cyclical Upturn

Needham analyst Charles Shi reiterated his buy rating on TSM stock with a price target of 115.

""TSMC's strong results suggest the industry is close to a bottom and about to enter the next cyclical upturn,"" Shi said in a client note.

TSMC management said the company is seeing signs of stabilization in PC and smartphone chip demand, he said.

""TSMC delivered what we think is its first clean beat of this down cycle, without any downward revision to its outlook,"" Shi said.

Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson kept his outperform rating on TSM stock. He also raised his price target on TSMC's Taiwan-traded shares.

""TSMC sales strength was driven by improvements in handset (Apple) and IoT (Internet of Things) end markets as well as a continuing solid contribution from HPC (high-performance computing),"" Bryson said in a client note. AI chip demand is strong but automotive chips are in an inventory adjustment period, he said.

Taiwan Semiconductor ranks No. 8 out of 32 stocks in IBD's semiconductor manufacturing industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. TSM stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 77 out of 99.

IBD's Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock's strengths. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.

"In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.

With such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)

At a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.

This year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.

NVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”

The hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”

Notably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.

In fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.

Is Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

NVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.

Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)

At a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P/S. Thus, it looks much more reasonably valued than NVIDIA, especially considering its five-year mean P/S of eight. However, a neutral view might be appropriate in the near term due to the geopolitical overhang for Taiwanese stocks.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enjoyed a nice 11% lift over the last five days due to NVIDIA’s good news, enjoying their best week in almost a year. TSM is likely to see some sales increase from the AI transition because it manufactures NVIDIA’s chips, but any impact is likely to be modest.

Unfortunately, the company could face issues amid the growing tensions between Taiwan and China, which convinced Warren Buffett to dump most of his $4.1 billion stake after less than a year. Given Buffett’s long-term focus, it’s highly unusual that he would sell the position after holding it for such a short time.

Thus, while Taiwan Semiconductor could end up being an excellent long-term investment at current prices, the recent rally paired with the geopolitical tensions suggests a neutral view for now.

Is Taiwan Semiconductor a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

Taiwan Semiconductor has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sells assigned over the last three months. At $118.67, the average Taiwan Semiconductor stock price target implies upside potential of 19.93%.

Conclusion: Bearish on NVDA, Neutral on TSM

NVIDIA and TSM clearly have excellent long-term prospects, given their AI exposure. However, it seems like buying NVIDIA shares at current prices could be playing with fire, given its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price.

TSM’s valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI, but the geopolitical overhang adds significant risk to owning the shares.

Wedgewood Partners made the following comment about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) detracted from performance, as revenues declined 10% from a year ago. The Company is lapping revenue growth of over +40% (compared to 2022) during every quarter of 2023, so it is more instructive to look at the health of the business through the lens of a multi-year timeframe. Most of the Company's customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to pandemic normalization. However, we think the longer-term trend of more silicon per device is still very much intact, and the Company is well-positioned to serve this, given its commanding market share in leading edge capacity. The Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment combined with tight development with fabless IC designers, plus the embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.""

The chip company's shares have seen an increase of 6.06% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 5.13% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.28%.

The upcoming earnings release of TSMC will be of great interest to investors. The company is predicted to post an EPS of $1.34, indicating a 26.37% decline compared to the equivalent quarter last year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $18.99 billion, down 4.71% from the prior-year quarter.

Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.97 per share and revenue of $66.45 billion. These totals would mark changes of -24.35% and -12.42%, respectively, from last year.

Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for TSMC. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.

Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system.

"TSMC (TSM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +13%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +10.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, which TSMC falls in, has gained 13.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, TSMC is expected to post earnings of $1.34 per share, indicating a change of -26.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

The consensus earnings estimate of $4.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -24.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

Story continues

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.80 indicates a change of +16.8% from what TSMC is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, TSMC is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Revenue Growth Forecast

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For TSMC, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $18.99 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $66.45 billion and $80.46 billion estimates indicate -12.4% and +21.1% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

TSMC reported revenues of $17.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.6%. EPS of $1.29 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.64 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.86%. The EPS surprise was +11.21%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

TSMC is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about TSMC. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?

Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about TSMC (TSM).

TSMC currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.50, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by six brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.50 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

Of the six recommendations that derive the current ABR, four are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 16.7% of all recommendations.

While the ABR calls for buying TSMC, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.

Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.

In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.

Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.

ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank

In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.

The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.

It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.

On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.

There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.

Is TSM Worth Investing In?

Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for TSMC, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.2% over the past month to $4.82.

Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.

The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for TSMC. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for TSMC with a grain of salt.

"In this article, I evaluated two chip stocks, Intel Corporation (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM), to determine which has the potential for better returns. We believe TSM is the better investment for the reasons explained throughout this piece.

Semiconductors are a crucial component of electronic devices, enabling advances in computing, communications, medical devices and healthcare, transportation, military systems, clean energy, and other numerous applications. Moreover, the U.S. semiconductor industry is the worldwide industry leader, with nearly half of global market share and sales of $275 billion in 2022.

As per a report by Precedence Research, the global consumer electronics market is expected to reach $1.26 trillion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 5.8%. Meanwhile, the U.S. consumer electronics market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.1% from 2023 to 2032. The market’s promising outlook reflects solid demand for advanced chips and processors.

Further, the growing adoption of emerging technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics boosts the prospects of the chip industry.

The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) announced global semiconductor sales for September 2023 grew 1.9% compared to August 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, worldwide semiconductor sales stood at $134.70 billion, up 6.3% compared to the second quarter of this year.

“Global semiconductor sales increased on a month-to-month basis for the seventh consecutive time in September, reinforcing the positive momentum the chip market has experienced during the middle part of this year,” said John Neuffer, SIA president and CEO.

“The long-term outlook for semiconductor demand remains strong, with chips enabling countless products the world depends on and giving rise to new, transformative technologies of the future,” Neuffer added.

Supportive government policies and funding would also create ample growth opportunities for the industry players. In July 2022, President Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act into law, which makes an approximately $53 billion investment in the U.S. for semiconductor manufacturing, research and development (R&D), and the workforce.

The global semiconductor market is estimated to reach around $1.88 trillion by 2032, expanding at a CAGR of 12.3% during the forecast period (2023-2032). The chip industry’s bright growth prospects should bode well for INTC and TSM.

INTC surged 4.5% over the past month, while TSM gained 2.6%. Also, INTC climbed 22.9% over the past six months compared to TSM’s 7.1% gain. However, INTC’s 32.7% gain over the past year is lower than TSM’s gain of 40.9%.

Here are the reasons why we think TSM could perform better in the near term:

Latest Developments

On October 30, INTC announced its intent to operate Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) as a standalone business. This move will give PSG the flexibility and autonomy to fully accelerate its growth and effectively compete in the FPGA industry, which serves various markets like the data center, communications, industrial, automotive, aerospace and defense sectors.

“Our intention to establish PSG as a standalone business and pursue an IPO is another example of how we are consistently unlocking more value for our stakeholders. This will give PSG the independence it needs to keep growing share in the FPGA market, differentiating itself with capacity and supply resilience from IFS, and allowing Intel product teams to focus on our core business and long-term strategy,” said Pat Gelsinger.

On September 27, TSM announced breakthroughs to redefine the future of 3D IC. The company launched the new 3Dblox 2.0, enabling 3D architecture exploration with an innovative early design solution for power and thermal feasibility studies.

The designer can now put together power domain specifications and 3D physical constructs in a holistic environment and simulate power and thermal for the whole 3D system. Also, TSM launched the 3Dblox Committee, organized as an independent standard group, to create an industry-wide specification enabling system design with chiplets from any vendors.

Recent Financial Results

For the third quarter that ended September 30, 2023, INTC’s net revenue decreased 7.7% year-over-year to $14.16 billion. Its gross margin came in at $6.02 billion, a decline of 7.9% from the prior year’s quarter. However, non-GAAP net income attributable to Intel was $1.74 billion or $0.41 per share, compared to $1.53 billion or $0.37 in the previous year’s period, respectively.

TSM’s net revenue increased 13.7% quarter-over-quarter to $17.28 billion in the third quarter that ended September 30, 2023. Its income from operations grew 12.9% from the prior quarter to $7.21 billion. The company’s net income and earnings per share were $6.66 billion and $0.26, representing increases of 16% and 16.1% sequentially, respectively.

Past And Expected Financial Performance

Over the past three years, INTC’s revenue has declined at a CAGR of 12.2%. Its EBITDA has decreased at a CAGR of 39.3% over the same period. However, the company’s tangible book value and total assets have improved at CAGRs of 22.5% and 9.1%, respectively, over the same time frame.

Analysts expect INTC’s revenue and EPS for the fiscal year (ending December 2023) to decline 14.6% and 98% year-over-year to $53.84 billion and $0.95, respectively. Likewise, the company’s revenue and EPS for the fiscal year 2024 are expected to grow 13.1% and 98% from the previous year to $60.89 billion and $1.89, respectively.

TSM’s revenue and EBITDA have grown at respective CAGRs of 18.6% and 20.9% over the past three years. Its net income has increased at a CAGR of 21.5%. Additionally, the company’s total assets have grown at a CAGR of 27.8% over the same time frame, while its levered free cash flow has improved at 28.3% CAGR.

For the fiscal year ending December 2023, TSM’s revenue and EPS are expected to decrease 10.8% and 22% year-over-year to $66.49 billion and $5.13, respectively. Also, analysts expect the company’s revenue and EPS for the fiscal year 2024 to increase 21.2% and 18% year-over-year to $80.59 billion and $6.05, respectively.

Profitability

TSM’s trailing-12-month revenue is 1.3 times what INTC generates. Moreover, TSM is more profitable, with a trailing-12-month gross profit margin of 57.02% compared to INTC’s 38.14%. Also, TSM’s trailing-12-month EBIT margin and net income margin of 45.66% and 41.43% are higher than INTC’s negative 3.94% and negative 3.11%, respectively.

In addition, TSM’s trailing-12-month ROE, ROA, and ROTC of 29.23%, 18.14%, and 15.49% are higher than INTC’s negative 1.60%, 1.47%, and negative 0.89%, respectively. TSM’s trailing-12-month levered FCF margin of 5.63% compared to INTC’s negative 8.47%.

Valuation

In terms of non-GAAP P/E (FY1), TSM is currently trading at 17.94x, 54.8% lower than INTC, which is trading at 39.73x. TSM’s forward non-GAAP PEG multiple of 2.50 is lower than INTC’s 17.07. Also, TSM’s trailing-12-month EV/EBITDA and Price/Cash Flow of 9.39x and 10.82x are lower than INTC’s 22.92x and 10.99x, respectively.

Thus, TSM is relatively more affordable.

POWR Ratings

INTC has an overall rating of C, which equates to a Neutral in our proprietary POWR Ratings system. Conversely, TSM has an overall rating of B, translating to a Buy. The POWR Ratings are calculated considering 118 different factors, with each factor weighted to an optimal degree.

Our proprietary rating system also evaluates each stock based on eight distinct categories. INTC has a grade of F for Growth, in sync with its poor financial performance. On the other hand, TSM has a B grade for Growth, consistent with its solid financials.

In addition, INTC has a C grade for Quality, in sync with mixed profitability. The stock’s trailing-12-month EBITDA margin of 15.69% is 71.4% higher than the industry average of 9.15%. However, its trailing-12-month net income margin of negative 3.11% compared to the industry average of 2.19%.

On the contrary, TSM has an A grade for Quality, justified by its higher-than-industry profitability. The stock’s trailing-12-month EBITDA margin and net income margin of 68.19% and 41.43% are significantly higher than the industry averages of 9.15% and 2.19%, respectively.

Of the 91 stocks in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry, INTC is ranked #37, while TSM is ranked #15.

Beyond what we’ve stated above, we have also rated both stocks for Sentiment, Stability, Momentum, and Value. Click here to view INTC Ratings. Get all TSM ratings here.

The Winner

Driven by growing demand for chips across several industries, such as consumer electronics, automobile, telecom, healthcare, and defense, the semiconductor industry is expected to witness significant growth in the long term. Further, the rapid adoption of cutting-edge technologies and supportive government policies and investments would propel the industry’s prospects.

Therefore, chip stocks INTC and TSM are expected to benefit considerably from the industry’s solid outlook. However, INTC’s relatively poor financials, low profitability, elevated valuation, and bleak near-term prospects make its rival, TSM, the better buy now.

Our research shows that the odds of success increase when one invests in stocks with an Overall Rating of Strong Buy or Buy. View all the top-rated stocks in the Semiconductor & Wireless Chip industry here.

"TSMC (TSM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month, shares of this chip company have returned +6.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - Circuit Foundry industry, which TSMC falls in, has gained 8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

TSMC is expected to post earnings of $1.34 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -26.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8.9%.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.97 points to a change of -24.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +3%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.80 indicates a change of +16.8% from what TSMC is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.

Story continues

Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, TSMC is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For TSMC, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $18.99 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $66.45 billion and $80.46 billion estimates indicate -12.4% and +21.1% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

TSMC reported revenues of $17.28 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -14.6%. EPS of $1.29 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.64 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.86%. The EPS surprise was +11.21%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.

"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?

Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about TSMC (TSM).

TSMC currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.60, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by five brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.60 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.

Of the five recommendations that derive the current ABR, three are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 60% and 20% of all recommendations.

The ABR suggests buying TSMC, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.

Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.

This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.

Story continues

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.

ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank

In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.

The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.

Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.

In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.

In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.

Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.

Is TSM a Good Investment?

In terms of earnings estimate revisions for TSMC, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.4% over the past month to $4.80.

Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.

The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for TSMC. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for TSMC with a grain of salt.
