"AMD wants people to remember that Nvidia’s not the only company selling AI chips. It’s announced the availability of new accelerators and processors geared toward running large language models, or LLMs.

The chipmaker unveiled the Instinct MI300X accelerator and the Instinct M1300A accelerated processing unit (APU), which the company said works to train and run LLMs. The company said the MI300X has 1.5 times more memory capacity than the previous M1250X version. Both new products have better memory capacity and are more energy-efficient than their predecessors, said AMD.

“LLMs continue to increase in size and complexity, requiring massive amounts of memory and compute,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said. “And we know the availability of GPUs is the single most important driver of AI adoption.”

Su said during a presentation that MI300X “is the highest performing accelerator in the world.” She claimed MI300X is comparable to Nvidia’s H100 chips in training LLMs but performs better on the inference side — 1.4 times better than H100 when working with Meta’s Llama 2, a 70 billion parameter LLM.

AMD partnered with Microsoft to put MI300X in its Azure virtual machines. Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott, a guest during Su’s speech, also announced the Azure ND MI300X virtual machines — first revealed in November — are now available on preview. Meta also announced it will deploy MI300 processors in its data centers.

Su said AMD released the MI300A APU for data centers, which she said are expected to grow its total addressable market to $45 billion. APUs generally combine CPUs and GPUs for faster processing. AMD said the MI300A offers higher-performance computing, faster model training, and a 30 times energy efficiency improvement. Compared to the H100, AMD said it has 1.6 times the memory capacity. It also features unified memory, so there is no need to move data from different devices anymore.

MI300A will power the El Capitan supercomputer built by Hewlett Packard Enterprise at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. El Capitan is considered one of the most powerful supercomputers and is expected to deliver more than two exaflops of performance.

The MI300A APU “is now in production and is being built into data centers.”

Pricing information was not immediately available.

Su teased the MI300 chips during the Code Conference, saying AMD was excited about the opportunity to tap more chip users, not just from cloud providers but from enterprises and startups.

AMD also announced the latest addition to its Ryzen processors, the Ryzen 8040, which can put more native AI functions into mobile devices. The company said the 8040 series offers 1.6 times more AI processing performance than previous models and integrates neural processing units (NPUs).

The company said Ryzen 8040 would not be limited to AI processing, as it claimed video editing would be 65 percent faster and gaming would be 77 percent faster than with competing products like Intel’s chips.

AMD expects manufacturers like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Razer to release products integrating Ryzen 8040 chips in the first quarter of 2024.

Su said the next generation of its Strix Point NPUs will be released in 2024.

AMD also announced the Ryzen AI Software Platform is now widely available, which will let developers building AI models on Ryzen-powered laptops offload models into the NPU so the CPU can reduce power consumption. Users will get support for foundation models like the speech recognition model Whisper and LLMs like Llama 2.","(amd, product manufacturer, instinct mi300x accelerator)

"Nearly a year ago, Nvidia kicked off this GPU generation with its GeForce RTX 4090. The 4090 offers unparalleled performance but at an unparalleled price of $1,600 (prices have not fallen). It's not for everybody, but it's a nice halo card that shows what the Ada Lovelace architecture is capable of. Fine, I guess.

The RTX 4080 soon followed, along with AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX and XT. These cards also generally offered better performance than anything you could get from a previous-generation GPU, but at still-too-high-for-most-people prices that ranged from between $900 and $1,200 (though all of those prices have fallen by a bit). Fine, I guess.

By the time we got the 4070 Ti launch in May, we were getting down to the level of performance that had been available from previous-generation cards. These GPUs offered a decent generational jump over their predecessors (the 4070 Ti performs kind of like a 3090, and the 4070 performs kind of like a 3080). But those cards also got big price bumps that took them closer to the pricing levels of the last-gen cards they performed like. Fine, I guess.

And then we get to the true midrange cards that most people can actually afford. In this price range, AMD and Nvidia offer minor updates for around the same money as the last generation's products, in the form of the 8GB 4060 Ti, the regular 4060, and the RX 7600. It was nice to have affordable-ish midrange GPUs again after years of inflated prices and shortages, but the generation-over-generation improvements were a lot less than people had come to expect from previous refreshes. Fine, I guess!

Advertisement

(Let's also lump Intel's Arc GPUs in with this group for the sake of completeness; they're competitive, but they had buggy drivers at launch and enduring performance issues in some older games. Fine, I guess.)

And now we get to the Radeon RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT, likely the last major launches of this GPU generation. Both take an approach we've seen from these other cards; the 7800 XT offers roughly the performance of the last-gen 6800 XT at roughly the same price, and the 7700 XT delivers a nice generational performance bump while bumping the price up to roughly what you would have paid for a last-gen card with the same performance. Fine! I guess!

That's not to say either is a bad GPU. The new Radeons outperform comparable Nvidia cards while either matching or undercutting their prices. And though they're marketed primarily as 1440p GPUs, both can stretch to 4K with the right graphics settings. But the continued presence of older, often-competitive Radeon cards on the market makes it tougher to recommend them in the short term, and features like ray tracing and DLSS remain unique to Nvidia cards. The two AMD GPUs are also priced too close together, with just a $50 gap between the 7700 XT and the substantially more performant 7800 XT.","(technology, primary operator, nvidia)

"AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI crown in a big way with the launch of its new Instinct processor, which it claims can do the work of multiple GPUs.

CEO Lisa Su called the Instinct MI300X “the most complex thing we’ve ever built.” She held up the chip, which is about the size of a drink coaster, at an event on Tuesday in San Francisco.

Weighing in at 146 billion transistors, the MI300X comes with up to 192GB of high-bandwidth HBM3 memory shared by both the CPU and GPU. It has a total of 13 chiplets on the die. The chip also has a memory bandwidth of 5.2 TB/s, which is 60% faster than Nvidia’s H100.

The chip consists of Zen CPU cores and AMD’s next-generation CDNA 3 GPU architecture. The enormous amount of memory is the real selling point, according to Su.

“If you look at the industry today, you often see that, first of all, the model sizes are getting much larger. And you actually need multiple GPUs to run the latest large language models,” she said. “With MI300X, you can reduce the number of GPUs for this, and as model sizes continue growing, this will become even more important. So with more memory, more memory bandwidth, and fewer GPUs needed.”

AMD says the design of the MI300X makes it eight times more powerful than the existing MI250X used in Frontier (the world’s fastest supercomputer) and five times more energy efficient. It will be used in the two-plus exaFLOP El Capitan system that will be built next year at Lawrence Livermore National Labs.","(amd, product manufacturer, instinct mi300x)

"Key Takeaways Shares of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) leaped more than 9% Wednesday after the company said sales of its AI chips could top $2 billion next year.

However, revenue for the current quarter is expected to be $300 million below analysts' consensus estimates.

AMD is ramping up its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) in an effort to catch up to its bigger rival Nvidia, a leader in the global AI race.

The company's MI300 processor, which the company has described as ""the world's most advanced accelerator for generative AI,"" could help the chipmaker catch up to its bigger rival.

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares leaped more than 9% Wednesday after the company said it expects to sell $2 billion in AI-powered chips next year as it attempts to catch up to market leader and rival Nvidia (NVDA).

The company, which reported better-than-expected third quarter earnings yesterday, is projecting revenue of $6.1 billion (plus or minus $300 million) in the last three months of the year. That number is up from $5.8 billion for the third quarter but below the $6.4 billion analysts had expected.

However, according to some analysts, AMD's lineup of AI processors is more important than its embedded business—chips for industrial, automotive and networking sectors.

According to Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson, the annual market for AMD's embedded business is less than $10 billion while rival Nvidia on its own is likely to exceed that number in quarterly GPU sales. So, the opportunity is big for AMD.

""In our view, meaningfully better growth expectations for AMD's AI products trump questions around where/when (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) FPGA sales will bottom and what is normalized revenue for AMD's embedded business,"" Bryson wrote in a note Wednesday. Field Programmable Gate Arrays are a type of circuit.

AMD Ramps Up AI Investments

AMD is ramping up its investments in artificial intelligence (AI) in an effort to catch up to rival Nvidia, which has become one of the world's biggest semiconductor companies with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion.

AMD's MI300 processor, which the company has described as ""the world's most advanced accelerator for generative AI,"" could help the chipmaker catch up to its bigger rival. Sales of AI-powered graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to reach $2 billion next year, AMD Chair and CEO Lisa Su said on the company's earnings call.

Su earlier this year called AI ""the defining technology shaping the next generation of computing and the largest strategic growth opportunity for AMD,"" and said the company is ""laser-focused on accelerating the deployment of AI platforms at scale in the data center.""

Shipments of MI300 processors are expected to begin by the end of 2023, Su said at a product showcase in June.

With Wednesday's gain, shares of AMD are up almost 69% so far this year. While impressive, it's a small gain compared to those of rival Nvidia, which has almost tripled year-to-date and is the S&P 500's best-performing stock this year.","(amd, product manufacturer, technology)

"Yesterday we reported that MSI announced a wave of firmware updates designed to address and alleviate potential issues with users on AM5 using AMD's Ryzen 7000X3D processors with 3D V-Cache. One of the main changes with MSI's latest UEFI firmware for AM5 included voltage restrictions when using Ryzen 7000X3D series CPUs. Further to recent reports of users with AMD Ryzen 7000X3D processors experiencing damage to their chip and motherboard socket, we reached out to AMD this morning to seek clarification. AMD has just responded with an official statement concerning the current problem.

The statement directly from AMD is as follows:

""We are aware of a limited number of reports online claiming that excess voltage while overclocking may have damaged the motherboard socket and pin pads. We are actively investigating the situation and are working with our ODM partners to ensure voltages applied to Ryzen 7000X3D CPUs via motherboard BIOS settings are within product specifications. Anyone whose CPU may have been impacted by this issue should contact AMD customer support.""

As the statement clarifies, AMD themselves are investigating the issue that users have been experiencing, which has been reported on through various channels such as social media and Reddit. This is further to MSI, which launched new firmware yesterday, and ASUS announced new firmware today for users with AMD Ryzen 7000X3D processors, such as the Ryzen 9 7950X3D and the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The new firmware specifically limits the SoC voltages applied so that these critical limits aren't breached when users enable AMD EXPO memory profiles on supported DRAM.

While AMD hasn't officially confirmed the problem regarding the burnt pads on the Ryzen 7000X3D series processors and the burnt pins within the motherboard socket, AMD is actively looking to resolve this issue. One theory thus far is that the issue is being triggered when users are enabling AMD EXPO memory profiles – which, much like Intel's XMP counterpart, is technically a form of overclocking and officially voids the product warranty. Given the rollout of new firmware, which targets SoC voltages and restricts them, all things point towards voltages and overclocking said processors, which are, by default, multiplier and CPU VCore locked.

AMD is actively working with motherboard vendors such as MSI, ASUS, GIGABYTE, and ASRock to roll out the new firmware. AMD also specifies that if users have a Ryzen 7000X3D processor affected by this problem, to contact AMD customer support directly.

Update (04/27): AMD has officially made a second statement regarding the Ryzen 7000 and 7000X3D burnout issues. It is as follows:

We have root caused the issue and have already distributed a new AGESA that puts measures in place on certain power rails on AM5 motherboards to prevent the CPU from operating beyond its specification limits, including a cap on SOC voltage at 1.3V. None of these changes affect the ability of our Ryzen 7000 Series processors to overclock memory using EXPO or XMP kits or boost performance using PBO technology. We expect all of our ODM partners to release new BIOS for their AM5 boards over the next few days. We recommend all users to check their motherboard manufacturers website and update their BIOS to ensure their system has the most up to date software for their processor. Anyone whose CPU may have been impacted by this issue should contact AMD customer support. Our customer service team is aware of the situation and prioritizing these cases.

"We haven't even gotten close to peak AI anything, but you won't be able to buy a new laptop next year without seeing it everywhere, notable in its absence as well as its presence. That's because the business interests of everybody who wants to sell you hardware or software are in complete alignment, which will result in a gravitational pull we can't escape. AMD on Wednesday jumped in that line with its new Ryzen 8040 series of mobile processors at its Advancing AI event.

On-chip AI acceleration is critical for mobile devices, because it ameliorates the battery-killing nature of continual AI processing, which is far more cost-effective and environmentally better to perform locally than in the cloud -- data centers to support consumer AI use are a black hole of energy usage and expensive to run. The accelerators are dedicated to iterating through and managing memory for the results of the vector calculations of small, pretrained models running on the device.

All the primary computer manufacturers now include a neural processing unit tile on its flagship processor's die. AMD added it with its Ryzen 7040 series, Qualcomm rolled out its Snapdragon Elite in October, Intel announced it as part of the new Meteor Lake architecture (its first chips with the accelerator are rumored to debut next week) and Apple made its Neural Engine a central part of its M series architecture from the start.

In parallel with its GPU capabilities, branded RDNA, AMD refers to its NPU's capabilities XDNA. The Ryzen 7040 series (Phoenix) included the first generation of the NPU. The mobile processors AMD announced Wednesday for its Ryzen 8040 series (Hawk Point) uses the same NPU architecture but offers better performance. AMD rates Phoenix at 10 trillion operations per second (by the NPU alone), while it says Hawk Point delivers 16 TOPS.

Laptops with the first series of Hawk Point chips are expected to be available by the end of March, and the company has its subsequent-gen XDNA 2 slated to ship to laptop manufacturers later in 2024. AMD claims those ""Strix Point"" Ryzen processors will offer three times better performance for generative AI over Hawk Point. And that may complicate your buy-now-or-wait decision.

Because CPU branding is complicated, don't assume that all 8040-series CPUs have the NPU. At the bottom of the stack, the two cheapest processors don't have it, which means the NPU may be out of the reach of budget buyers.

The Acer Nitro V 16, announced Wednesday. Acer

One of the spotlight products announced, the updated 16-inch Acer Nitro V 16 gaming laptop goes ""up to"" a Ryzen 7 8845HS and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, but a mystery base configuration starts at $1,000. Who knows if that base includes an NPU-equipped CPU or how price scales for the configurations. Acers equipped with the NPU will use it for optimizing battery life and expanded power-management features. The Nitro's expected to ship in March, in line with the wait we usually have from announcement to shipping of new chips this time of year.

Another reason for the aligned push is to motivate software developers to use the application programming interfaces in order to offload much of the inferencing and generative work the way they address the graphics accelerator for a smoother experience with interactive graphics tasks.

There are a lot of developers who already use custom AI models, like Adobe, Zoom, OBS (in OBS Studio, for streamers) and Microsoft. But there's a multitude of APIs for handling the on-device model and interaction with the operating system -- WindowsML, Intel OpenVINO, Nvidia's integration into its own software (like DLSS in the graphics driver and Broadcast) and more. It's still all shaking out.","(technology, product manufacturer, amd)

"AMD’s RDNA 3 graphics architecture has proven its ability to deliver significant performance improvements and better energy efficiency over its RDNA 2 graphics cards. This has been a boon for gaming, but one could argue this will be even better for workstation cards. We got an idea of what a high-performance RDNA 3 workstation card can do with the AMD Radeon Pro W7800 ($599). Now, with the Radeon Pro W7600, we get to see what a balanced solution can do, and it does quite well in its own way with low power draw and a compact build.

Design: Radeon RX 7600 Goes to Work

Anyone who has kept up with the most recent graphics card releases will find the Radeon Pro W7600 to be familiar. That’s because the card is similar to the AMD Radeon RX 7600 in many ways. Both cards feature the same GPU core, with the exact same amount of resources available and even the same memory interface. You'll find only a handful of details that differ between the two cards.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

Workstation cards are often packed in with as many other cards as possible into a chassis to gain extra performance, which makes the size and cooling scheme of cards matter more than with consumer-grade graphics cards, which nowadays are mostly installed solo. This led AMD to design the W7600 as a more complacent single-slot card that would enable you to wedge far more cards in together than with dual-slot cards. Naturally, this comes with some trade-offs, including a smaller cooler and a slightly lower clock speed.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

Other than that, the biggest changes between the W7600 and the RX 7600 lie in the BIOS, which is optimized for workstation tasks on the W7600. You'll also notice the price difference that sets the W7600 at $599, which is more than double the Radeon RX 7600’s base price of $269. Professional-grade products are priced differently for businesses and generally are sold in bulk purchases.

The ports on the card were also changed up slightly versus the Radeon RX 7600, with no HDMI port and four DisplayPort 2.1 connections. The power connections can vary somewhat on Radeon RX 7600 cards, but most of those also ship with a single 8-pin PCIe power connection, whereas the Radeon Pro W7600 instead relies on a single 6-pin PCIe power connection instead.

Test Setup and Spec Comparison

The AMD Radeon Pro W7600 was tested using our 2022 GPU test bed with an Intel Core i9-12900K processor and an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard. The processor was operated at stock clock speeds with a Corsair Hydro Series H100X water cooler and 32GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM clocked at 5,600MHz.

To ensure the system has plenty of power for all tests, I equipped the test bed with a Corsair HX1500i power supply that can handle up to 1,500 watts of power. All tests were performed inside of Windows 11 Pro with all of the latest updates installed.

Before diving into the test results, it’s important to note that the Radeon Pro W7600 and the similar Radeon Pro W7500 are markedly different products from the other cards we were able to test. These AMD GPUs are far less expensive, far more compact, and of course have far fewer resources. This resulted in them being outperformed in most tests. But, on the rare occasions they pushed ahead slightly, we can be sure it was due entirely to the advantages inherent in these being workstation cards.

Synthetic Tests

3DMark’s Port Royal is a useful test for graphics cards that takes full advantage of ray-tracing hardware on GPUs. Adobe’s Premiere Pro and Luxmark are both focused on testing content creation and GPGPU performance.

Though the Radeon Pro W7600 performed poorly in these tests compared with the other cards, it's not a bad showing if you consider the price-for-performance ratio. The Radeon Pro W7800 costs $2,499, and this makes the $599 W7600 hitting about a third or more of its performance numbers seem like a moderate bargain. However, for these particular tests, you’d be better off with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, which was faster than both while costing just $999.

SPECworkstation 3.1

Tests that are more oriented towards workstation cards, like those included in the SPECworkstation 3.1 test suite, give us a better idea of the Radeon Pro W7600’s potential.

In all of these tests, the Radeon Pro W7600 continued to perform at least about a third as fast as the Radeon Pro W7800, and in many tests it fared far better than that. This may not sound like a win for the Radeon Pro W7600, but it’s worth remembering that these cards are intended to be used in tandem with other workstation cards. You could buy four Radeon Pro W7600 cards for slightly less than what a single Radeon Pro W7800 costs, and those cards working together might net you better results than what that sole W7800 card can muster.

That said, we can’t speak to exactly how it would perform, as scaling across multiple cards is never quite so straightforward. Nevertheless, it’s possible that would result in better performance overall than the Radeon Pro W7800. This also holds up in comparison with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, which is already behind the Radeon Pro W7600 in select test sets like medical-02, snx-03 (Siemens CAD), and sw-04 (Solidworks). In many of the tests that show the RTX 4090 ahead, adding a second Radeon Pro W7600 would tend to even things up or hand the win to the Radeon Pro W7600 cards.

AIDA64 GPGPU Tests

AIDA64 proves highly useful for testing workstation cards and graphics cards alike. It tests a number of different metrics but doesn’t tend to favor the workstation cards.

The memory bandwidth portion of the AIDA64 gives us insight into the bandwidth between the RAM and the GPU on a graphics card, which is always vitally important to performance. The Radeon Pro W7600 has just a 128-bit memory interface, which left it at a disadvantage here. This is in part what caused it to lag behind the other cards in this test, with its significantly fewer resources being the other part of what held it back.

Though these results look bleak, it’s again worth considering the significant difference in price, as it performed better than you would expect for a card that costs far less than the competition.

Game Tests

Workstation cards are not intended for gaming, but games serve far too well at pushing cards to their limits and gauging their performance for us to not utilize them here for testing as an ""interesting aside.""

Though you can get similar results with an RX 7600 for less, the Radeon Pro W7600 ran the games we tested well even at higher resolutions. Running games at 4K was a bit of a struggle, but this was helped by FSR that boosted frame rates back to playable levels.

Power Consumption

Using a Kill-A-Watt power meter, I measured the power draw of the GPU test bed as a whole in order to determine the rough power consumption of each of the tested cards while running the AIDA64 GPGPU test. Only the graphics card in question was changed between tests, which gives us a relative idea of the power consumption of each card.

This is one area in which the Radeon Pro W7600 came out well ahead of its competition. When it came to performance, the Radeon Pro W7600 may have achieved only a third of the W7800’s output, but it also consumed far less power. This makes the card all the more alluring for use inside of compact systems and especially those that have strict power and heat limitations.

Verdict: A Slim Sleeper Workstation Card

AMD's Radeon Pro W7600 managed to perform relatively well throughout our tests. It never beat out the competition, but as most of the competing cards cost significantly more, are far larger, and draw far more power, that’s to be expected. Instead, the card performs reasonably well for its place in the market, driving a hefty amount of compute performance at a far more palatable price of $599 and with a much more compact form factor and lower power draw.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

These characteristics help it stand out for those that need some amount of compute performance for workstation applications but don’t need or can’t afford the likes of an AMD Radeon Pro W7800. That said, if you don't need to run workstation applications, the shine comes off; you'd be better off considering consumer cards that will work well enough for less.

"When discussing GenAI, the term “GPU” almost always enters the conversation and the topic often moves toward performance and access. Interestingly, the word “GPU” is assumed to mean “Nvidia” products. (As an aside, the popular Nvidia hardware used in GenAI are not technically Graphical Processing Units. I prefer SIMD units.)

The association of GenAI and GPUs with Nvidia is no accident. Nvidia has always recognized the need for tools and applications to help grow its market. They have created a very low barrier to getting software tools (e.g., CUDA) and optimized libraries (e.g., cuDNN) for Nvidia hardware. Indeed, Nvidia is known as a hardware company, but as Bryan Catanzaro, VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, Nvidia has stated ” Many people don’t know this, but Nvidia has more software engineers than hardware engineers.”

As a result, Nvidia has built a powerful software “moat” around their hardware. While CUDA is not open source, it is freely available and under the firm control of Nvidia. While this situation has benefited Nvidia (As it should. They invested time and money into CUDA), it has created difficulties for those companies and users that want to grab some of the HPC and GenAI market with alternate hardware.

Building on the Castle Foundation

The number of foundational models developed for GenAI continues to grow. Many of these are “open source” because they can be used and shared freely. (For example, the Llama foundational model from Meta) In addition, they require a large number of resources (both people and machines) to create and are limited mainly to the hyperscalers (AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Meta Platforms, and Apple) that have huge amounts of GPUs available, In addition to the hyperscalers, other companies have invested in hardware (i.e. purchased a massive amount of GPUs) to create their own foundational models.

From a research perspective, the models are interesting and can be used for a variety of tasks; however, the expected use and need for even more GenAI computing resources is two fold;

Fine-tuning — Adding domain-specific data to foundational models to make it work for your use case. Inference – Once the model is fine-tuned, it will require resources when used (i.e., asked questions).

These tasks are not restricted to hyperscalers and will need accelerated computing, that is, GPUs. The obvious solution is to buy more “unavailable” Nvidia GPUs, and AMD is ready and waiting now that the demand has far outstripped the supply. To be fair, Intel and some other companies are also ready and waiting to sell into this market. The point is that GenAI will continue to squeeze GPU availability as fine-tuning and inference become more pervasive, and any GPU (or accelerator) is better than no GPU.

Moving away from Nvidia hardware suggests that other vendor GPUs and accelerators must support CUDA to run many of the models and tools. AMD has made this possible with HIP CUDA conversion tool; however, the best results often seem to use the native tools surrounding the Nvidia castle.

The PyTorch Drawbridge

In the HPC sector, CUDA-enabled applications rule the GPU-accelerated world. Porting codes can often realize a speed-up of 5-6x when using a GPU and CUDA. (Note: Not all codes can achieve this speed up, and some may not be able to use the GPU hardware.) However, in GenAI, the story is quite different.

Initially, TensorFlow was the tool of choice for creating AI applications using GPUs. It works both with CPUs and was accelerated with CUDA for GPUs. This situation is changing rapidly.

An alternative to TensorFlow is PyTorch, an open-source machine learning library for developing and training neural network-based deep learning models. Facebook’s AI research group primarily develops it.

In a recent blog post by Ryan O’Connor, a Developer Educator at AssemblyAI notes that the popular site HuggingFace, (that allows users to download and incorporate trained and tuned state of the art models into application pipelines with just a few lines of code), 92% of models available are PyTorch exclusive.

In addition, as shown in Figure One, a comparison of Machine Learning papers shows a significant trend toward PyTorch and away from TensorFlow.

Of course, underneath PyTorch are calls to CUDA, but that is not required because PyTorch insulates the user from the underlying GPU architecture. There is also a version of PyTorch that uses AMD ROCm, an open-source software stack for AMD GPU programming. Crossing the CUDA moat for AMD GPUs may be as easy as using PyTorch.



Instinct for Inference

In both HPC and GenAI, the Nvidia 72-core ARM-based Grace-Hopper superchip with a shared memory H100 GPU (and also the 144-core Grace-Grace version) is highly anticipated. All Nvidia released benchmarks thus far indicate much better performance than the traditional server where the GPU is attached and accessed over the PCIe bus. Grace-Hopper represents an optimized hardware for both HPC and GenAI. It also is expected to find wide use in both fine-tuning and inference. Demand is expected to be high.

AMD has had shared memory CPU-GPU designs since 2006 (AMD acquired graphics card company ATI in 2006). Beginning as the “Fusion” brand many AMD x86_64 processors are now implemented as a combined CPU/GPU called an Accelerated Processing Unit (APU).

The upcoming Instinct MI300A processor (APU) from AMD will offer competition for Grace-Hopper superchip. It will also power the forthcoming El Capitan at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The Integrated MI300A will provide up to 24 Zen4 cores in combination with a CDNA 3 GPU Architecture and up to 192 GB of HBM3 memory, providing uniform access memory for all the CPU and GPU cores. The chip-wide cache-coherent memory reduces data movement between the CPU and GPU, eliminating the PCIe bus bottleneck and improving performance and power efficiency.

AMD is readying the Instinct MI300A for the upcoming inference market. As stated by AMD CEO Lisa Su in a recent article on Yahoo!Finance. “We actually think we will be the industry leader for inference solutions because of some of the choices that we’ve made in our architecture.”

For AMD and many other hardware vendors, PyTorch has dropped the drawbridge on the CUDA moat around the foundational models. AMD has the Instinct MI3000A battle wagon ready to go. The hardware battles for the GenAI market will be won by performance, portability, and availability.

"On Friday, we told you how AMD is quietly arming a whole new wave of Steam Deck competitors. But the company’s now saying the quiet part out loud: today, it’s officially announcing the AMD Ryzen Z1 and Ryzen Z1 Extreme, a pair of 4nm processors specifically aimed at handheld gaming PCs.

The Ryzen Z1 Extreme pairs eight of AMD’s Zen 4 CPU cores and 16 threads with 12 of its RDNA 3 graphics cores as well as 24MB of cache — and promises up to a whopping 8.6 teraflops of raw graphic performance, far closer to the 10.28 teraflops of a Sony PS5 than the 1.6 teraflops you get with a Steam Deck.

Meanwhile, the vanilla Ryzen Z1 has six CPU cores and 12 threads, four GPU cores, and 22MB of cache — that’s still enough for a theoretical 55 percent increase in raw graphical potential over Valve’s custom Zen 2 plus RDNA 2 “Aerith” chip.

What does that mean for games? With a Z1 Extreme, if you’re playing at 720p with low settings like you might comfortably do on a seven-inch handheld, AMD claims you can cross the 60fps line for games as demanding as Red Dead Redemption 2 and more than double that for Forza Horizon 4 — all upscaled to 1080p with AMD’s Radeon Super Resolution.

I do wonder if “low” means “lowest” here — I would not want to run Tomb Raider on lowest because of muddy graphics, but that’s less of a problem with other games. Image: AMD

With a Z1, you lose the edge in some of the most demanding games, but the numbers aren’t bad! “I think what’s going on here: it’s not the CUs that are the limiting factor, it’s the LPDDR5,” says AMD senior technical marketing manager Don Woligroski. “The fast memory is, a lot of these cases, what these games are really hungry for.”

Image: AMD

These benchmarks aren’t from some sprawling bench-mounted test bed, by the way: they’re running on an “advanced engineering sample” of the Asus ROG Ally handheld gaming PC, says Woligroski, who ran these tests himself. The Ally will be sold in both Z1 and Z1 Extreme configurations, Asus spokesperson Ester Suh confirms to The Verge.

And here are the native 1080p results from AMD. Wouldn’t want to run Red Dead Redemption 2 or Far Cry 6 that way, but I could see locking my screen to 30fps or 40fps for demanding games. Image: AMD

But before you go talking about the ROG Ally as a “Steam Deck killer,” consider the TDP — Woligroski says all these benchmarks were run in the Ally’s “Turbo Mode,” which lets the processor draw up to 30 watts, depending on the game. The Steam Deck’s processor runs at just half that and can typically make it to the two-hour mark in all but the most demanding games with its 40 watt-hour battery.

If the ROG Ally has a much bigger battery or runs competently at the same 15 watts, it might not matter. (AMD also says the Z1 and Z1 Extreme support its Radeon Chill, which can automatically save power based on the frame rate targets of your choice, and the Ally has its own frame limiter, too.) Just keep this in mind as you interpret these performance charts.

AMD says the Z1 and Z1 Extreme are temporarily exclusive to Asus but that we may see other partners in the future with these or future Z chips — the Z handheld gaming PC branding is here to stay. Currently, it’s a partnership between AMD’s gaming group (which handles Radeon GPUs) and client (which handles Ryzen processors).

As for the Ryzen 7840U, a chip that appears to be a dead ringer for the Z1 Extreme and may appear in any number of rival boutique handheld gaming PCs in place of the Z1, Woligroski can’t say. “We haven’t officially announced any 7000U series parts yet.” He wants you to know that the Z1 isn’t simply a matter of rebranding future laptop parts, though, adding that it uses customized power and voltage curves, among other differences. I’ve asked for a larger list of changes.

In a press release, AMD writes that Asus will announce ROG Ally pricing and “more information” about availability on May 11th.",,"{""SECTOR"": [""Technology""]}","{""title"": ""AMD announces Ryzen Z1 and Z1 Extreme chips for handheld gaming PCs"", ""publisher"": ""The Verge"", ""authors"": ""Sean Hollister"", ""published_date"": ""2023-04-25""}"
"Yesterday, AMD issued a statement surrounding the burnout issues some users have been experiencing with their Ryzen 7000X3D processors. The problem, reported in multiple Reddit subforums, includes some Ryzen 7000X3D CPUs burning out part of the chip, and damaging the AM5 socket in the process. This morning, AMD has released a second statement regarding the issue, including what it is doing to rectify the problem and put Ryzen 7000 processor owners at ease.

The official statement from AMD is as follows:

""We have root caused the issue and have already distributed a new AGESA that puts measures in place on certain power rails on AM5 motherboards to prevent the CPU from operating beyond its specification limits, including a cap on SOC voltage at 1.3V. None of these changes affect the ability of our Ryzen 7000 Series processors to overclock memory using EXPO or XMP kits or boost performance using PBO technology. We expect all of our ODM partners to release new BIOS for their AM5 boards over the next few days. We recommend all users to check their motherboard manufacturers website and update their BIOS to ensure their system has the most up to date software for their processor. Anyone whose CPU may have been impacted by this issue should contact AMD customer support. Our customer service team is aware of the situation and prioritizing these cases.""

To counteract the problem, AMD has apparently identified an issue with specific chip voltages going too high when users enable AMD's EXPO memory profiles. A new cap on SoC voltages looks to be the primary change in the AGESA firmware rollout.

However, AMD's broad statement mentions that the update will address multiple power rails, which implies to some degree that the issue may be more than just the SoC power rail – or at least, that AMD isn't taking any chances. So what this entirely means is still a bit up in the air, as AMD hasn't specified in detail what it's doing outside of SoC power limits to prevent Ryzen CPUs from exceeding their specification limits.

Technically speaking, enabling EXPO memory profiles is a form of overclocking – i.e. operating the processor outside of specifications – as AMD's Ryzen 7000 family only officially supports DDR5 memory up to DDR5-5200 speeds. So going past this is putting additional stress on the memory controller in terms of clockspeeds; but the greater concern is how the various voltages on the chip are being adjusted to keep up with the demands of higher memory speeds.

One interesting point about AMD's statement is that it doesn't allude to whether or not the issue is just on its Ryzen 7000X3D processors, or whether it affects all of its Ryzen 7000 processors entirely. Regardless of the Zen 4 chip that users may have, AMD is ambiguous in its language, and it seems to be that AMD is recommended that all users with a Ryzen 7000 series processor should update to the latest firmware.

In practice, enabling EXPO memory profiles on compatible DRAM does seem to push SoC voltages beyond AMD's safe spot on the Ryzen 7000 processors, which AMD is treating as part of the cause of the burnout issue. AMD does, however, state that the changes it has made to their AGESA firmware, once flashed, shouldn't affect the user's ability to apply EXPO memory profiles on compatible kits of DDR5 memory. Which does raise the question of why motherboards were increasing SoC voltages in the first place, as presumably this shouldn't be needed if AMD's new caps won't limit EXPO memory overclocking.

In any case, AMD is actively working with its motherboard partners to release a new AGESA firmware with the new voltage limits, which they say has already been distributed. AMD claims that all AM5 motherboard vendors and models should have a new BIOS version available to them within the next few days, and is recommending all users to update their BIOS at their earliest convenience.

"If you were intrigued by AMD's Ryzen 9 7950X3D but didn't want to spend $700 on a processor, the $450 Ryzen 7 7800X3D might be the chip you've been waiting for.

Like the more-expensive X3D chips, the 7800X3D is a regular Zen 4 processor with an extra 64MB of L3 cache stacked on top of it. That extra cache isn't always useful, but it does tend to boost game performance, and AMD has marketed the X3D series mostly to PC gamers looking for a processor to pair with high-end GPUs like the GeForce RTX 4090 and Radeon RX 7900 XTX.

The X3D chips all come with compromises, mainly in the form of lower clock speeds and less-flexible overclocking support. But if you mainly care about games, the good news is that the 7800X3D runs them just as well as the more-expensive 7950X3D for less money, and it does so without generating too much heat or using too much power.

Advertisement

People building a midrange gaming PC should continue to save money with a cheaper CPU and spend more on a GPU instead, and anyone using a socket AM4 system should still consider a CPU upgrade before upgrading to a whole new platform. But if you're trying to build a new high-end PC around a top-end GPU, the 7800X3D is probably the cheapest way to make sure you're letting that graphics card shine.

Pricing comparisons

At $449 (assuming, as ever, that you can find it in stock at that price), the 780X3D's pricing could be described as ""upper-midrange"" or maybe ""the low end of the high end."" It's way more than the $200–$250ish you'll pay for a very good all-around CPU like the Ryzen 5700/5800 series or any number of 12th- and 13th-generation Core i5 chips, but still less than top-end contenders like the Ryzen 9 7950X or Core i9-13900K.

Its pricing competes most directly with processors like the 16-core (8P/8E) Core i7-13700K or the 12-core Ryzen 9 7900 (note the lack of X). Both of these chips offer better performance in work that benefits from a lot of CPU cores, but neither is quite as good at gaming.","(technology, product manufacturer, amd)

"Back at CES 2023, AMD announced the first wave of Ryzen Mobile parts based on its Zen 4 architecture, the Ryzen Mobile 7040HS series. Based on AMD's Phoenix silicon, which uses TSMC's 4 nm process node to mix Zen 4 CPU cores with AMD's RDNA 3 graphics compute units all in a single, monolithic die, Phoenix is the next generation of high efficiency, highly-integrated AMD silicon. And today, AMD is revealing that Phoenix is going to spread its wings a little farther, with the announcement of the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series for ultraportable notebooks.

Bringing AMD's latest generation technologies down to the thin and light laptop market, the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series follows AMD's traditional cascading launch mobile launch strategy, delivering new silicon into increasingly lower powered devices as chip production ramps up and OEMs finish putting together new designs. Whereas the original 7040HS series is aimed at higher-power, higher performing laptops, the 7040U series tunes the same same silicon for more modest TDPs in the 15 Watt to 30 Watt range, making it better suited for use in ultraportable thin and light laptops – and fully exploiting the efficiency advantages of Zen 4.

We've been expecting the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series for quite some time now – AMD made it clear as far back as CES that a traditional U-series lineup was in the works, but until now we just didn't know when to expect it. Though considering that you still can't buy a 7040HS laptop today, today's 7040U announcement from AMD should not be taken as a sign that 7040U laptops are going to be on retail shelves any time in the immediate future.

AMD Ryzen 7040U Series: Up to 8-Cores With RDNA 3 Graphics

AMD's Ryzen Mobile 7040 series spans multiple key mobile product categories, ranging from the entry-level, which AMD segments as 'everyday computing' to its 'extreme gaming and creator' lineup for high-end and powerful gaming laptops. At the bottom of AMD's Pheonix Point series for mobile, the new AMD Ryzen Mobile 7040U series is comprised of four SKUs, which range from 8-core parts down to 4-cores; all of which include AMD's RDNA 3 integrated graphics. Phoenix also introduces AMD's Ryzen AI technology, an FPGA-based AI engine developed by Xilinx, which AMD claims are the first AI processor of its kind and is designed to accelerate AI workloads.

As they announced at CES 2023, AMD has updated its mobile naming scheme to make it somewhat easier for users to decipher what all the digits and characters in the product name mean. For the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series, the first digit represents the model year, with 7 being used for 2023, while the second digit represents the market segment, e.g., Ryzen 7 = 7, Ryzen 5 = 5/6, and Ryzen 3 = 3/4. The third digit (4) represents the CPU architecture of the product, so in the case of the 7040, it uses its latest Zen 4 cores.

The last character (suffix) is perhaps the most important indicator of the market segment, as it relates to the TDP and form factor, as the U relates to being a 15-30 W part. For those of you playing at home, this is a slight increase in the TDP window over previous generations – where the U series was 15-28 W – though with laptop vendors able to set their TDPs wherever they like, official TDPs are more of loose guidelines these days anyhow.

Looking at the four Ryzen 7040U SKUs for thin and light AMD-based notebooks, all four of its 'Pheonix' based APUs include AMD's RDNA 3 Radeon 700M series integrated graphics. Starting with the premier model, the Ryzen 7 7840U is an 8C/16T part with a base frequency of 3.3 GHz and a turbo frequency of up to 5.1 GHz. It has a combined total cache of 24 MB, with 16 MB of L3 cache for the entire chip and 1 MB of L2 cache per core, for a total of 8 MB of L2 cache.

Moving down the stack is a pair of Ryzen 5 models, the Ryzen 5 7640U and Ryzen 7540U, both of which include 6 CPU cores. The Ryzen 5 7640U is the faster of the two chips, with a 300 MHz bump on CPU base frequency over the 7540U (3.5 v.s 3.2 GHz), though both APUs have a turbo frequency of up to 4.9 GHz. Curiously, AMD is also using this point as the dividing line between what parts do or do not get the Ryzen AI co-processor; the upper-tier 7640U comes with it, but the lower-tier 7540U does not. Past that, the Ryzen 5 7640U and Ryzen 5 7540U are 6-core parts, so they have 16 MB of L3 cache and 6 MB of L2 cache.

As these are Ryzen 5 mobile Zen 4 APUs, they include AMD's Radeon 700M graphics. The Ryzen 5 7640U has the better iGPU of the two, with the Radeon 760M with 8 CUs with a maximum frequency of up to 2.6 GHz. In comparison, the Ryzen 5 7540U has the lower spec Radeon 740M with 4 CUs, although both iGPUs feature the same 16 ROPs/2 RB+ blocks.

The entry-level option to AMD's Zen 4 7040U series chips is the Ryzen 3 7440U, which is a quad-core APU (4C/8T) with a base frequency of 3.0 GHz, a turbo frequency of up to 4.7 GHz. This part also includes the Radeon 740M (4 CU) integrated graphics. As this is a 4-core part, AMD has significantly reduced the amount of available cache, for a combined total of 12 MB that's split into 8 MB of L3 cache and 4 MB of L2 cache.



Block diagram of the AMD Radeon 780M integrated graphics

It's worth pointing out that the Radeon 780M with 12 compute units (CU) has four Render Backends (RB+) blocks within the silicon, while both the Radeon 760M (8 CU) and Radeon 740M (4 CU) feature just two RB+ blocks. Compared to the Ryzen Mobile 6000 series, AMD has also improved the graphics frequencies, with the Radeon 780M clocking up to 2.7 GHz, which is 300 MHz faster than the Radeon 680M, which hit up to 2.4 GHz.

AMD Ryzen 7040U With Ryzen AI: One Xilinx XDNA Block Included

AMD's acquisition of Xilinx, which closed in February of last year, means they have been able to feed Xilinx's expertise and architecture into its latest Zen 4 products. The most prominent example is what AMD calls Ryzen AI, which is part of Xilinx's XDNA architecture. This XDNA-based architecture has been enabled within two of the four Ryzen 7040U series SKUs, with the top two SKUs, the Ryzen 7 7840U and Ryzen 5 7640U, getting access to the Ryzen AI block integrated into the silicon. The inclusion of 'Ryzen AI' is to bolster the capability of AMD's Phoenix processors in AI inference workloads, offering more efficient task-specific silicon than what the CPU or GPU are capable of.

Another interesting highlight of AMD Ryzen AI is that it directly supports Microsoft's Studio Effects pack within Windows 11, which AMD claims can only be enabled by a dedicated engine like AMD Ryzen AI. While an interesting inclusion to the silicon for AI workloads, AMD hasn't provided or published any expected performance figures to accompany the announcement.

While we typically take a robust stance in digesting in-house performance figures, we usually don't take these at face value with in-house benchmarks optimizing things for favorable results. AMD did, however, provide some compute, and gaming performance figures comparing the performance of the Ryzen 7 7840U to Intel's Core i7-1360P and compute performance against Apple's M2 silicon.

AMD is claiming up to 175% gains in Passmark 10 performance over Apple's M2 chip while offering up to 228% Media Encode performance over the Core i7-1360P; these are undoubtedly best-case figures and are to be taken with a pinch of salt. Interestingly in the gaming performance figures, which it put up its Ryzen 7 7840U with Radeon 780M integrated graphics again Intel's Core i7-1360P with Iris Xe graphics, it's not too surprising to see that the Radeon 780M performed between 130% and 239% better than Intel in specific titles. If nothing else, AMD typically invests in more GPU silicon for their high-end mobile processors.

Regarding battery life, AMD states that it has heavily invested in efficiency leadership designed to bolster battery life by implementing Smart Power Management. As with previous announcements of its 7040HS series, AMD has yet to indicate how long battery life might be. Still, as partners and notebook vendors start to integrate Ryzen 7040U APUs with Zen 4 into their solutions, we'll eventually see how efficient AMD's Ryzen Mobile 7040U 15-30 W chips are compared to the previous generation.

Ryzen 7040U Launch: No Date as of Yet, But Expected Very Soon

One of the most significant talking points surrounding AMD's Ryzen 7040 mobile series is when they will launch. Early indications from AMD stated that we should start seeing broader adoption of its 7040 chips sometime in March. AMD announced to us in mid-March that it had pushed back the launch of its Ryzen Mobile 7040HS series until April.

As for the AMD Ryzen Mobile 7040U series, AMD isn't announcing any kind of release date or expected availability date at this time. Given the timing of AMD's announcement – a few weeks before Computex – we expect we'll find out more about the specific laptops in development and their expected release dates at that show.","(technology, product manufacturer, amd)

"Looking at the graphics card market, it’s pretty clear - even to a casual observer - that AMD has ceded a significant amount of ground to Nvidia in the high-end arena.

The RTX 4090 is arguably the best graphics card ever made, and Nvidia still dominates the PC gaming space as per the Steam Hardware Survey .

Now, it looks like AMD is ready to surrender its high-end GPU market share entirely, with new leaks suggesting Team Red won’t be selling high-powered Radeon cards at all in its next generation.

Navi4 lineup will not have any high-end GPUsThink of it like RDNA1 or Polaris generation.August 4, 2023 See more

Multiple leakers have claimed that AMD has canceled production of its Navi 41 and 42 GPUs, instead focusing on the less powerful Navi 43 and 44. Prolific GPU leaker @Kepler_L2 outright stated on Twitter (well, X, but I refuse to use that ridiculous name) that the “Navi4 lineup will not have any high-end GPUs”, while @All_The_Watts commented ominously that “Only Navi 43 and Navi 44 survive.”

What this means in practice is that we likely won’t see an RX 8800 or RX 8900 in the next generation of Radeon cards, nor any ‘XT’ or ‘XTX’ variants of those GPUs. Presumably, the flagship card will now be a decidedly midrange Radeon RX 8700 XT (or some variation on that name).

Why is AMD scaling back its GPU aspirations?

While it’s easy to write off this move as AMD simply admitting defeat in the enthusiast GPU space against the juggernaut that is Nvidia, there’s actually a very different key factor at play here.

As claimed by Bits And Chips , AMD plans to scale back RX 8000 production with chip manufacturer TSMC in favor of general-purpose GPUs and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) - two types of components commonly used for AI training and development.

AMD will sacrifice next Radeon gaming GPUs (RX8000) output at TSMC in order to pump up FPGA and GPGPU production.September 8, 2023 See more

We’ve already seen rumblings that the rise of AI could lead to another GPU shortage - in fact, Nvidia made more than $10 billion dollars in just three months thanks to the recent AI boom brought on by the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT . In fact, our own John Loeffler predicted that Nvidia’s AI success would mean the end of its GeForce GPUs - and it looks like AMD might be taking that lesson to heart.

To be fair to Team Red, it’s not an unwise move; while I personally loved the Radeon RX 7900 XTX , it’s undeniable that Nvidia has won the current round of the GPU war with its powerful high-end cards. Despite that, AMD’s more affordable cards like the RX 7600 remain an excellent proposition for cash-strapped gamers - so if making GPUs for AI is unavoidable right now, focusing its efforts on the midrange and budget space is a smart decision.

I personally used an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT for almost two years and found it to be a very dependable GPU - so if AMD can deliver a solid performance uptick over its currently-available midrange cards and also keep the price at a sensible level, we could see Team Red produce some of the best cheap graphics cards in the not-too-distant future.","(technology, product manufacturer, amd)

"The carefully sequestered, rock-solid-reliable PC I use to test graphics cards became completely and utterly hosed this week. I couldn’t even get the system to boot into Windows repair mode to try to troubleshoot it. The culprit? A rare conflict in the way Windows interacts with AMD’s latest WQHL-certified Radeon drivers, Adrenalin 23.2.2. Some quick Googling revealed that this has been happening to a small handful of other users since Adrenalin 23.2.1 landed in mid-February, with similarly devastating effects.

This experience would be an absolute disaster for anyone who isn’t the executive editor of a computer publication with a deep rolodex on hand (though AMD representatives are very responsive to driver feedback on social media). But fortunately, I was able to work closely with AMD on on the issue.

AMD engineers not only managed to diagnose the potential root cause of this exotic issue, but also discovered a just-as-exotic troubleshooting workaround that helped revive my PC. A permanent fix is being investigated, but affected users can hopefully use this workaround to repair their systems without resorting to a full-blown fresh Windows install.

Here’s what happened, how it happened, how you can avoid it, and how you can fix it if a similar disaster strikes your PC.

How AMD’s Radeon drivers broke my Windows install

I received a new custom Radeon RX 7900 XT for testing this week, so I went about my usual strict process for making sure the PC is up-to-date and ready to benchmark. Before swapping in a new graphics card or new drivers, while my existing stable setup is still intact, I perform several steps to make the system as “like new” as possible, to avoid potential issues caused by swapping in different GPUs from different brands. (The system hardware stays static, with minimal software installed beyond benchmarking tools, to ensure consistency.)

This is a rig from AMD’s Radeon RX 7900-series reveal, not my test system. Adam Patrick Murray / IDG

I already had a GeForce RTX 4070 Ti set up to give Nvidia’s awesome RTX Video Super Resolution a whirl. With it installed, I manually updated Windows 10. Then, I powered down the system and replaced the 4070 Ti with the Radeon RX 7900 XT. It booted up normally. I then used Windows 10’s Add and Remove Programs tool to uninstall all Nvidia software from my PC and rebooted. Standard stuff. I then used the fantastic DDU Uninstaller tool to ensure that Nvidia’s bits were truly and completely eradicated, and rebooted. Everything went fine.

Then the problems started.

I opened up Chrome, navigated to AMD’s website, and downloaded the WQHL-certified Adrenalin 23.2.2 drivers that the site recommended for a 7900 XT. Then I installed the driver, checking the box to perform a “factory reset” clean installation rather than an upgrade-in-place. It turns out that checking that box, done in conjunction with a silent Windows update occurring in the background without my knowledge, probably led to my rig’s downfall.

Everything went well—until the software said I needed to reboot my PC to finish the driver installation. After restarting, my system hit the MSI BIOS splash page like normal, but the second it tried loading Windows it immediately suffered a Blue Screen of Death, flashing the “Inaccessible Boot Device” error code shown in the image in the tweet below (which is unrelated to this AMD issue). Ugh. The system then started an endless cycle of BSOD > reboot > BSOD > reboot without kicking off automatic repair attempts or presenting me the usual Windows troubleshooting options.

How can I enter safe mode before booting in Windows 10? AFAIK You can do that in Windows 7.



INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE pic.twitter.com/3u9oQ5f0Kc — Tridashie (@Tridashie) November 25, 2019

I didn’t have time to troubleshoot it so I powered down the system and tried again the next day. Same deal. I yanked out the custom Radeon RX 7900 XT I need to test and replaced it with AMD’s reference Radeon RX 7900 XT. This time, after two BSOD > reboot cycles, Windows attempted to automatically repair the system after the BIOS splash screen. Success! …or so I thought. But I was terribly, terribly wrong.

Instead of correcting the issue, selecting Startup Repair made it even worse. When it was done, the screen went dark and completely unresponsive (while still powered on). Now, whenever I tried to boot the computer, I saw the little “Windows thinking about it” circle spinning after the BIOS screen for a brief moment, then a return to the infinite blackness. My Windows install was hosed so hard that the BSOD crashes didn’t even occur anymore, and I had no chance to try standard Windows troubleshooting efforts.

In desperation I tried replacing the Radeon RX 7900 XT with the RTX 4070 Ti and an Intel Arc A750—GPUs I’ve tested in the past two weeks, that worked reliably—but to no avail.

Be careful when you install the latest Adrenalin 23.2.1. Backup your data!#AMD #Driver https://t.co/dOVZSth7OQ — CapFrameX (@CapFrameX) February 15, 2023

Googling the issue surfaced this WCCFTech article from mid-February along with plenty of other coverage, citing numerous user reports of Adrenalin 23.2.1 destroying their Windows installs. It is a deeply frustrating experience, and one that would be disastrous for a standard PC gamer. I tweeted about my woes and an AMD representative emailed me within minutes. Obviously, being the executive editor of PCWorld may fast-track me for a quick response (though again, AMD representatives are very responsive to driver feedback on social media). In this case, my high-profile headaches managed to help AMD probe the core issue, so I can provide troubleshooting steps that worked for me and happily report that a permanent fix is being investigated.

How to fix Radeon drivers breaking your Windows install

I could’ve simply slapped in a new SSD with a clean Windows install, but we spent two days going through various troubleshooting fixes while AMD engineers tried reproducing and diagnosing the problem. Swapping GPUs, trying new monitors, yanking the display cable out at different times, clearing the CMOS, and ensuring UEFI was selected instead of CSM in the BIOS (it was!) all proved fruitless.

But this morning, AMD’s team got back to me with another suggestion: When the BIOS splash screen is up right after turning on the PC, slam the power button to try to coax Windows into forcing an automatic recovery attempt. I tried it four times to no avail. I was told to keep it up, that it would work eventually. And after fifteen total tries, it did!

I’m not sure what caused it to finally catch, but timing seemed to play a part in it. Hitting the power button while the BIOS keypress options were up simply turned off my PC immediately. Hitting it once the spinning “Windows thinking” icon appeared kept the PC on, but did nothing—my system simply black-screened again. Eventually, I managed to hit the power button in the split second between the BIOS options disappearing and the Windows circle appearing, and that managed to kickstart an automatic recovery attempt.

You want to select the System Restore option and select a restore point from prior to the Windows corruption. Windows should automatically have created one just before installing the new GPU drivers. IDG

Success!

After Windows did its thing for a bit, I eventually wound up in the Windows recovery tools menu, able to restart my PC or select advanced options. I went into the advanced options’ troubleshooting menu and selected System Restore, since Startup Repair hosed my PC even worse before. I selected a restore point from mid-February, loaded it up, and after two agonizingly frustrating days, my test rig was back in action.

If you’ve suffered from the recent Adrenalin drivers corrupting your Windows install, try this process to hopefully get back on your feet. You should also trying the usual arcane method for summoning the Windows recovery tool, found in the “Use the Startup Repair function” section here. (Don’t use Startup Repair though! Use a restore point! Just use this process to get you to the menu with both options.)

But how did this happen, and how can you prevent it from happening to you?

How to avoid Radeon drivers breaking your Windows install

AMD tells me it took dozens of attempts to recreate the issue in their labs due to its extreme rarity. On a call, one representative actually called me “patient zero.” The company provided me with the following statement while its investigation is ongoing:

“We have reproduced an issue that can occur in an extremely small number of instances if a PC update occurs during the installation of AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition, and we are actively investigating. We recommend users ensure all system updates are applied or paused before installing the driver, and that the “Factory Reset” option is unchecked during the AMD driver installation process. We are committed to resolve issues as quickly as possible and strongly encourage users to submit issues with AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition via the Bug Report Tool.”

It’s worth noting that my version of Windows 10 was updated prior to attempting the Adrenalin Software install, but the Game Bar or some other part of Windows may have been silently updating in the background to kickstart this disaster.

DO NOT click “additional options” and check the “factory reset” box until the core issue is fixed! AMD

As a workaround, simply don’t check that factory reset box if you’re installing new Radeon drivers. There’s no reason to do so if you’ve already got a working Radeon GPU set up and are simply updating to the latest drivers anyway. Simple as that. It worked for me after my test system was revived and I now have Adrenalin 23.2.2 installed and working like a charm.

A damned shame

It’s a damned shame this happened. Most excruciatingly for myself and other gamers who had their Windows install deeply broken, of course, but also for AMD.

I’ve been a vocal advocate for the serious driver and software improvements AMD has been making over the last half-decade or so. People slammed the iffy state of Radeon drivers for years. AMD listened and poured tremendous investment and effort into polishing them up. Now, Team Red’s drivers are even better than Nvidia’s popular Game Ready drivers in many ways, and in June 2022 AMD felt confident enough about its software to declare that it offers “industry-leading stability” with “99.95% of users experiencing no crashes when AMD Software is installed.”

There’s no doubt that AMD’s driver stability and overall stability are now right up there with the best of them after years of intense refinement. This is an extremely unusual edge case—though it’s happening to enough people that I felt compelled to write about my woes. It sure sucks being in that 0.05%! But issues this catastrophic hurt the cause to rebuild Radeon software’s image, no matter how rare they are. Regardless of whether Windows or AMD is to blame in the end, this experience is the sort of thing that would immediately make many PC gamers swear off Radeon GPUs forever, and tell all their friends why. And that’s a shame.

This remains the best 1080p graphics card for most people Radeon RX 6600 Swft 210 Read our review Price When Reviewed: $329.99 Best Prices Today:

Several Radeon GPUs hold spots in our roundup of the best graphics cards. I’m not going to remove them despite my personal disaster. This severe issue isn’t widespread, only occurring in ultra-rare circumstances, while AMD offers truly compelling value up and down the stack with Nvidia hiking GeForce prices through the roof. And yes, AMD’s drivers are indeed rock-solid the vast majority of the time. This particular scenario could have been catastrophic without AMD’s direct help, but no software is perfect—especially in the complex PC ecosystem—and while I got stuck in a deeply frustrating situation, there’s only a microscopic chance of it affecting you. (And hopefully this article can help you if it does.)

Most people don’t check the factory install box anyway. Just be sure you don’t either until a permanent fix is released.","(technology, product manufacturer, amd)

"As AMD is now well into their third generation of RDNA architecture GPUs, the sun has been slowly setting on AMD’s remaining Graphics Core Next (GCN) designs, better known by the architecture names of Polaris and Vega. In recent weeks the company dropped support for those GPU architectures in their open source Vulkan Linux driver, AMDVLK, and now we have confirmation that the company is slowly winding down support for these architectures in their Windows drivers as well.

Under AMD’s extended driver support schedule for Polaris and Vega, the drivers for these architectures will no longer be kept at feature parity with the RDNA architectures. And while AMD will continue to support Polaris and Vega for some time to come, that support is being reduced to security updates and “functionality updates as available.”

For AMD users keeping a close eye on their driver releases, they’ll likely recognize that AMD already began this process back in September – though AMD hasn’t officially documented the change until now. As of AMD’s September Adrenaline 23.9 driver series, AMD split up the RDNA and GCN driver packages, and with that they have also split the driver branches between the two architectures. As a result, only RDNA cards are receiving new features and updates as part of AMD’s mainline driver branch (currently 23.20), while the GCN cards have been parked on a maintenance driver branch – 23.19.

At present, AMD has not published anything about this change in driver support to their website. But, responding to a request for a comment on Windows driver support from AnandTech, the company provided the following statement:

The AMD Polaris and Vega graphics architectures are mature, stable and performant and don’t benefit as much from regular software tuning. Going forward, AMD is providing critical updates for Polaris- and Vega-based products via a separate driver package, including important security and functionality updates as available. The committed support is greater than for products AMD categorizes as legacy, and gamers can still enjoy their favorite games on Polaris and Vega-based products.

Notably, AMD is actively asserting that this is not “legacy” status for Vega and Polaris, which is an important distinction because of what “legacy” means within AMD’s ecosystem. For AMD, legacy products are effectively considered end-of-life, and ongoing driver support is retired. Which in the case of previous generation GPU architectures going legacy, AMD did not have any further driver releases of any kind planned – though in practice AMD did release a couple of drivers to fix critical security issues.

AMD’s support plans for Vega and Polaris, by contrast, still call for regular driver releases, albeit without major feature updates or performance optimizations. That means receiving bug fixes and other occasional updates as AMD sees fit to backport them to the older driver branch, but not the full scope of updates that AMD’s RDNA products are now receiving via their up-to-date mainline driver. In practice, this is much closer to how NVIDIA has handled their legacy GPU products, which have traditionally received security fixes for a minimum length of time – making for a more welcome offramp for going from fully supported to unsupported.

But regardless of what AMD is calling their driver support policy for Polaris and Vega, the end result is that major driver development for these GPU architectures has effectively come to an end, and these parts have now entered an extended support phase. AMD considers the drivers for the hardware mature, and with games increasingly taking advantage of features not supported by the hardware (e.g. Alan Wake II and mesh shaders), there’s clearly less of a need to add support/optimizations for new games to drivers for old hardware.

More broadly speaking, with the current high-end game consoles using a RDNA2-ish (DX feature level 12_2) architecture, we’re finally approaching a rather hard switch that will be leaving pre-12_2 GPUs behind. Consequently, I’m not surprised to see AMD semi-retire both Polaris and Vega at the same time – there is a clear gulf in archtiecture between GCN and the greatly reworked RDNA that underpins AMD’s more recent cards.

AMD Recent GPU Driver Releases Adrenaline RDNA GCN 4 & 5 23.11.1 (November) 23.20.23.01 23.19.05.01 23.10.2 (October) 23.20.17.03 N/A 23.9.3 (September) 23.20.11.04 23.19.02 23.8.2 (August) 23.10.29.06

As AMD enacted this driver split back in September, we can already see some of the ramifications of this with AMD’s latest drivers. Polaris and Vega did not receive an October driver release (Adrenaline 23.10), and the November release (Adrenaline 23.11.1) contains only a handful of fixes for GCN cards, as opposed to the much more extensive list of fixes and new game support for RDNA cards.

Ultimately, while the remaining GCN GPUs haven’t been put out to pasture quite yet, this is clearly the beginning of the end for a line of GPU architectures that stretches back to AMD’s 2011 GPU architecture modernization. AMD has been selling Polaris (GCN 4) cards since mid-2016 – starting over seven years ago – and in practice the core compute and graphics architecture of GCN 4 is virtually identical to the even older GCN 3 architecture. Consequently, AMD has essentially been supporting that core GPU architecture for almost 9 years at this point.

GCN 4 & 5 Products Desktop Mobile Radeon VII Radeon 600 Mobile Series Radeon RX Vega Series Radeon 500 Mobile Series Radeon Pro Duo Radeon 400 Mobile Series Radeon 600 Series Ryzen Mobile 7030U Series Radeon RX 500 Series Ryzen Mobile 5000 Series Radeon RX 400 Series Ryzen Mobile 4000 Series Ryzen 5000G Series APUs Ryzen Mobile 3000 Series Ryzen 4000G Series APUs Ryzen Mobile 2000 Series Ryzen 3000G Series APUs Ryzen 2000G Series APUs

Meanwhile, things are a little more short-lived for the newer Vega GPU architecture (GCN 5). While AMD introduced the first discrete Vega GPUs and video cards in mid-2017 – and replaced the whole lot of them in mid-2019 – that GPU architecture remained in use in current-generation products for much longer as an integrated graphics solution. AMD’s current desktop APUs, the Ryzen 5000G series, integrate a Vega GPU. And the same silicon is still sold in the mobile space as the budget-minded Ryzen Mobile 7030 series. So although the Vega architecture is only a year younger than Polaris, it has stuck around for much longer overall.

Unfortunately, that does also mean that these Vega-based APUs are also getting something of the short end of the stick when it comes to driver support, receiving only a few years of mainstream driver support before being deprioritized. Though as these are also the weakest Vega GPUs, they’re admittedly also the least likely to be used with new games. More critical here will be how long AMD supplies security fixes for the Vega GPU architecture, especially since GPU drivers are popular targets for privilege escalation attacks.

In any case, while this isn’t a eulogy for the final members of the Graphics Core Next GPU architecture – at least, not quite yet – it’s clear that, 12 years later, GCN’s time is finally approaching its end.","(technology, product manufacturer, amd)

Specs at a glance: Framework Laptop 13 (2023) OS Windows 11 22H2 CPU AMD Ryzen 7 7840U (8-cores) RAM 32GB DDR5-5600 (upgradeable) GPU AMD Radeon 780M (integrated) SSD 1TB Western Digital Black SN770 Battery 61 WHr Display 13.5-inch 2256x1504 non-touchscreen in glossy or matte Connectivity 4x recessed USB-C ports (2x USB 4, 2x USB 3.2) with customizable ""Expansion Card"" dongles, headphone jack Price as tested $1,679 pre-built, $1,523 DIY edition with no OS included

The Framework Laptop 13 is back again.

My third review of this laptop is probably the one that I (and many Framework-curious PC buyers) have been the most interested to test, as the company has finally added an AMD Ryzen option to the repair-friendly portable. Updates to the Intel version of the Framework Laptop have boosted CPU performance, but its graphics performance has been at a standstill since the Framework Laptop originally hit the scene in mid-2021.

Even AMD's latest integrated graphics won't make a thin-and-light laptop a replacement for a gaming PC with dedicated graphics, but a bit more GPU power makes the Framework Laptop that much more versatile, making it easier to play games at reasonable resolutions and settings than it is on Intel's aging Iris Xe graphics hardware.

Whether you hopped on the Framework train early and have been waiting for a motherboard that felt like a true all-around upgrade or you've been on the fence about buying your first Framework Laptop, the new Ryzen version makes a good case for itself. If you want to order one, there's currently a backlog—all versions are shipping at an unspecified date in ""Q4.""

Meet the Ryzen-powered Framework 13

I won't spend a lot of time talking about the design of the Framework Laptop 13 again, except to say that it remains a competent ultraportable, and there's nothing that feels dated or clunky about its design now that didn't already feel a little dated and clunky two years ago (the relatively thick display bezel is the main culprit here). Another laptop in this category we generally like, Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon, has been using the same basic design for years, so it's not like Framework is in danger of falling behind in a chaotic and fast-paced industry.

Advertisement

The Ryzen version of the mainboard looks mostly identical to the Intel version, given that it needs to fit in all the same cases with all the same connectors. It dropped directly into the same case I've also used for the Intel versions of the Framework Laptop, and moving from Intel to AMD is as easy as it is in a desktop tower with standard parts.

But it wouldn't be a Ryzen system if there weren't a couple of weird, fiddly things about it! All the Intel Framework Laptops have supported the same specifications for all four ports (USB 4 for the 11th-gen, Thunderbolt 4 for the newer ones), allowing you to install the expansion card modules wherever you want them without worrying about the particulars.

The Ryzen laptop supports USB 4 in the rear-left and rear-right ports, USB 3.2 and DisplayPort for the front-right slot, and only USB 3.2 on the front-left slot (all four ports support USB-PD for charging, though). Framework also says the rear ports enter a ""high-power mode"" when USB-A modules are connected to them, which can reduce battery life.

So yes, the Framework Laptop's ports are still customizable, and you can still have a lot of flexibility when installing expansion modules. But some modules are better fits for specific ports, and you'll have to be a bit more careful about where you put things if you want the best performance and battery life.","(technology, product manufacturer, framework)

"Earlier this year, I found myself in a bit of a dilemma. Due to some personal circumstances I'd rather not go into, I needed a new system, and I needed it fast. It'd been a while since I'd built myself a new PC from scratch, and given that my profession revolves around keeping up to date with the latest hardware, I decided that I was going to put my money where my mouth is and build something with plenty of gaming grunt but to a reasonable budget.

No RTX 4090s for me, I thought. I'd need to build myself something with great performance, but not ridiculous when it comes to the strain on my bank account. It could be done. I knew it could.

CPU, RAM and motherboard? Easy picks, and I treated myself to a platform upgrade with the latest AM5 gear. PSU, case, SSD? Child's play. But like I suspect many of you building a new PC on a budget this year experienced, when it came to picking the GPU, things got difficult.

Here's an admission. After a long day of writing about some of the best hardware in the world, comparing spec sheets and benchmarks and price comparisons, when I close my browser windows and boot up a game what I'm really looking for is easy. I don't want to fiddle with too many settings, and run benchmark after benchmark in my own free time. I just want to sink into the warm bath that is a good PC game running smoothly, and so my quick and dirty hack is this: whack the resolution to 1440p, set the graphics preset to high (not ultra), and press play.

Cheating, I know, but for me and I'm sure many others, this is usually the sweet spot for stable, high frame rate gaming with great image quality on a good system. So what I was looking for was something with excellent 1440p high-setting performance, and I didn't want to spend much more than £500.

The obvious choice here was the RTX 4070, and I came really, really close to buying one. Nothing wrong with 'em. Very good cards indeed. But that 12GB of VRAM bugged me a little, as it felt just a little on the tight side for a card I'd hoped would last me a while. And while I nearly pulled the trigger more than once, perhaps most importantly of all, it was difficult to find one near my target budget at that point in time. Too pricey. Just.

Then came the release of the AMD RX 7800 XT. And that really threw the proverbial cat amongst the pigeons.

I'd always admired AMD GPUs, but if I'm honest, from something of a distance. Testing them in other machines was fine, good even, but when it came to my personal picks I always went Nvidia. Not out of some misguided brand loyalty you understand, but simply because whenever it came down to sizing up the amount of performance I'd get for my money, when it came time to lay down my cash it was always an Nvidia card that made the most sense.

Not so here, as the AMD RX 7800 XT gives the RTX 4070 a serious run for its money in the benchmarks, even outright beating it in many, and for less cash to boot. And so I thought, and I thought, flitting back and forth between the two. Fretting even. Dare I be brave?

And then I bought the AMD card, on offer for just shy of £500 at the time. And let me tell you: For my purposes, it's been a delight.

Yes, I don't get to revel in the glory that is DLSS 3. Nor is my new GPU much cop at ray tracing, a bug bear that I foolishly hope will be improved in future with some magical driver update, but let's face it, won't. But other than that, my RX 7800 XT has been, for want of a better word, brilliant.

This feels like a card designed to hit Nvidia where it hurts. It was designed to sway gamers like me, and I have to say it worked.

I went for a three fan model, and as a result it runs cool and quiet. Because I'd also picked an AMD Ryzen CPU all my primary driver needs are handled by AMD Adrenalin, and I haven't heard a peep from it since it's been installed. I remember the bad old days of AMD driver issues, but in my admittedly short term experience I have yet to experience a single problem. I hope fervently that this continues.

Performance? Well yes, the aforementioned ray tracing issues are not great. That being said, I've been hammering away at Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty in my spare time, and it's been running at 1440p ultra settings (broke my own rule, I know) with ray tracing off and no upscaling at mostly over 100 fps. It looks great. It feels great. Do I feel a slight twinge when I see a puddle, and realise it'd be prettier if my card was better at handling ray tracing? Sure. Once or twice.

But ultimately, I want smooth, I want fast, I want hassle-free, and I don't want to pay through the nose for it. Ultimately I just want to play my gosh-darn games at high frame rates and great image quality without any fuss, and for that the RX 7800 XT has been superb.

I can hear the rumblings already. It's not really any faster than the RX 6800 XT it replaced. FSR isn't quite as good as DLSS. The idle power draw, etc, etc. But this feels like a card that was designed to hit Nvidia where it hurts, and steal its lunch. It was designed to sway gamers like me, and I have to say, for me personally, it worked.

I shall not apologise. It's been great, and each time I sit down to enjoy my games it quietly gets on with the job of delivering them to me, at speed, and it didn't rampage through my savings account in order to do it. In real-world, day-to-day terms it's my favourite piece of hardware this year, and yes, I will die on this hill.

I submit my personal rig to the altar of AMD. Please don't ruin the drivers and let me down. I beg of thee.","(amd, supplier-customer, xfx)

"AMD already closed the Intel gap for gaming with its Ryzen 9 7950X3D, and now it’s ready to go a step further. The Ryzen 7 7800X3D has been the chip everyone has been waiting to see the benchmarks for after the previous Ryzen 7 5800X3D dominated gaming CPUs for a long time. While the 7800X3D arrives more than a month after the 7950X3D, I can confidently say it was well worth the wait.

The new Ryzen 7 7800X3D is priced at $449, with eight cores, 16 threads, and a boost clock up to 5GHz. It’s designed to compete with Intel’s flagship Core i9-13900K (around $589), AMD’s flagship Ryzen 9 7950X3D ($699), and even Intel’s $699 Core i9-13900KS processor that runs at up to 6GHz out of the box.

AMD’s 7800X3D has impressed me a lot. At $449, it offers some of the best PC gaming performance you can find right now, while delivering it in a package that consumes a lot less power than Intel’s equivalents. It’s so impressive that I think it should be most people’s next gaming PC CPU.

I’ve been testing out AMD’s 7800X3D with MSI’s Meg X670E Ace motherboard, 32GB of G.Skill DDR5 6000 RAM, and Nvidia’s RTX 4090. This is one of the latest AM5 motherboards, so it has a single PCIe 5.0 M.2 slot and three PCIe 4.0 M.2 slots for plenty of storage options for PC games.

Unfortunately, we don’t have a 5800X3D in our labs at the moment, but I’ve tested a variety of workloads, synthetic benchmarks, and games across AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D, the 7950X3D, Intel’s Core i9-13900K, and the 13900KS. All tests were run on the latest Windows 11 2022 Update with VBS security disabled on all systems. Resizable BAR has been enabled, and tests were run primarily at 1080p resolution to help avoid any potential GPU bottlenecks and to analyze the raw CPU performance.

AMD’s Ryzen 7 7800X3D blows past Intel’s Core i9-13900K in all of the seven games I tested at 1080p and max or ultra settings. Both F1 22 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider run more than 15 percent faster on the 7800X3D, and Watch Dogs: Legion is 9 percent faster on this latest AMD CPU.

I was surprised to see Nvidia’s RTX 4090 pushing 366fps at 1080p in Shadow of the Tomb Raider with the 7800X3D, which edges past the top performance I saw on the 7950X3D. Even Metro Exodus sees some solid performance gains for the 7800X3D over both the 13900K and 7950X3D.

AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D performance (1080p) Benchmark AMD 7800X3D Intel Core i9-13900K AMD 7950X3D Intel Core i9-13900KS Metro Exodus (ultra / high) 187fps 159fps 158fps 157fps Shadow of the Tomb Raider 366fps 308fps 354fps 313fps Gears 5 255fps 235fps 213fps 241fps Assassin's Creed Valhalla 212fps 209fps 207fps 215fps Watch Dogs: Legion 169fps 155fps 156fps 158fps Cyberpunk 2077 217fps 210fps 209fps 223fps F1 22 447fps 388fps 423fps 389fps Geekbench 5 single-thread 2002 2130 2204 2211 Geekbench 5 multithread 13601 26241 23205 26730 Cinebench R23 single-thread 1764 2169 2023 2163 Cinebench R23 multithread 17672 38704 35524 39410 Blender Fishy Cat 00:16.3 00:13.0 00:13.1 00:13.2 PugetBench for Premiere Pro 1060 1227 1288 1354 PugetBench for Photoshop 1490 1646 1550 1678 3DMark Time Spy CPU 13410 21179 16475 20858

All of these results are impressive for AMD at 1080p, but since I typically run a smaller selection of games for our CPU tests, I wanted to test some of the games I typically use for GPU reviews, too. In fact, this CPU has impressed me so much that it will be the primary rig for testing future GPUs here at The Verge.

So I really wanted to put the 7800X3D more head-to-head with Intel’s Core i9-13900KS in an expanded gaming test at 1080p. The 13900KS is a souped-up version of the 13900K, with a 6GHz top boost speed and tweaked base clocks that are designed to boost PC gaming performance. It’s the best Intel has to offer for PC gaming right now, but it’s also $699 compared to the $449 pricing of the 7800X3D.

AMD 7800X3D vs. Intel 13900KS (1080p) Benchmark AMD 7800X3D Intel Core i9-13900KS Shadow of the Tomb Raider 366 313 Shadow of the Tomb Raider + DLSS 2 quality 365 310 Forza Horizon 5 Extreme 224 207 Forza Horizon 5 + DLSS 2 quality 216 200 Forza Horizon 5 + DLSS 3 quality 316 318 CS:GO 816 880 Gears 5 255 241 Metro Exodus Enhanced Ultra 187 157 Metro Exodus Enhanced Extreme 145 141 Returnal 223 225 Assassin's Creed Valhalla 212 215 Watch Dogs: Legion 169 158 Watch Dogs: Legion + DLSS 2 + RT 164 155 Cyberpunk 2077 217 223 Cyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 2 quality + RT 155 158 Cyberpunk 2077 + DLSS 3 quality + RT 255 245

In the 16 game tests at 1080p, the 7800X3D came out on top 10 times. Most of the losses are super close, with the exception of CS:GO, where Intel’s 13900KS manages to beat the 7800X3D by nearly 8 percent. All the other times the 7800X3D loses out, it’s less than a 3 percent lead for Intel here. It’s a similar story at 1440p, where the 7800X3D is able to beat the 13900KS in most tests or lose on a small margin.

AMD’s latest X3D CPU only really loses out on the productivity side.

Where AMD doesn’t win is on the productivity side. The 7800X3D falls well behind Intel here. Both of AMD’s top X3D chips lose out to Intel on PugetBench’s Photoshop test, Geekbench 5, and Cinebench R23. The 7800X3D isn’t really designed to take on productivity tasks, so this isn’t surprising, and for that, you’d really want the 7950X3D instead or Intel’s Core i9-13900K.

But if you only care about gaming, the 7800X3D is the obvious choice given the combination of performance improvements, price, and power usage. It’s genuinely impressive how efficient AMD’s 7800X3D is here. I tested the 7800X3D running Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K with maxed-out ray-tracing settings, and the CPU package power hit a peak of 67 watts. Intel’s 13900KS hit a maximum of 275 watts for the same task.

I also saw the 13900KS hit 329 watts during a Cinebench run, whereas the 7800X3D only hit a peak power draw of 86 watts. While the 13900KS delivers far better Cinebench performance and a small bump to frame rates in games like Cyberpunk 2077, it’s delivering better performance in most games without the extra power draw.

The 7800X3D also maxed out at 84 degrees Celsius during a Cinebench run, compared to 101 degrees Celsius max on the 13900KS. Much like the 7950X3D, the 7800X3D has a TDP of 120 watts, down from the 170-watt TDP found on the original Zen 4 7950 chip. Intel uses a base power of 125 watts on the Core i9-13900K, and it has pushed this to 150 watts on the 13900KS. At max turbo power, both of Intel’s latest chips go above 250 watts and can go even further if a motherboard allows it.

The efficiency of AMD’s latest X3D chips is thanks to its latest Zen 4 architecture and a combination of its impressive 3D V-Cache technology. 3D V-Cache works so well in games because they don’t need a high amount of CPU cores and power. Instead, they favor CPUs that can process data quickly with large amounts of cache. Productivity apps don’t typically favor huge amounts of cache, so we don’t see the same performance gains in those tasks.

The 7800X3D, much like the 7950X3D, requires a new AM5 motherboard. These boards have support for DDR5 memory and up to 24 PCIe 5.0 lanes. The first PCIe 5.0 consumer SSDs are set to launch soon, but most will still use PCIe 4.0 SSDs for now. The PCIe 5.0 support on AM5 boards is great for futureproofing, but you won’t need it for GPUs anytime soon. Nvidia’s latest RTX 40-series cards don’t support this latest standard, and we haven’t hit the limits of PCIe 4.0 for GPUs yet.

Existing AM4 coolers should also work just fine with AM5 boards. I’ve been able to use Corsair’s H150 Elite LCD without any changes required on the 7800X3D, 7950X3D, and regular 7950. It’s worth checking with your cooler manufacturer to make sure that existing AM4 models can easily be used with these new AM5 motherboards, though.

You’ll also need to make sure you configure a new BIOS option to ensure boot times are reasonable. I noticed some early issues with the DDR5 memory training process during my Ryzen 9 7900X review, with an additional boot time of around 30 seconds. AM5 motherboards ship with a “memory context restore” BIOS option that you need to have enabled to reduce boot times.

I initially had issues with this system stability with this setting enabled this on MSI’s Meg X670E Ace motherboard. After reporting the issues to both MSI and AMD, MSI supplied an updated BIOS that fixed the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) that I saw.

The 7800X3D is a great gaming PC choice.

AMD’s 7800X3D is a truly impressive gaming CPU. AMD closed the gap with the 7950X3D, and now it’s going beyond that and flexing its efficiency at the same time. If I were building a gaming PC right now, I would pick the 7800X3D without a doubt.

If you use your PC for both gaming and productivity apps like Photoshop, Premiere Pro, or something similar, then the 7950X3D is a better option for those who need performance in both. Both of AMD’s top options pack some great PC gaming performance in processors that won’t cost as much to run. That’s important in many markets that are still feeling the effects of rising energy bills or for anyone who wants their PC gaming to impact the environment less.

The 5800X3D became the popular option for PC gamers, and I think the 7800X3D is here to shine for 2023 and beyond.","(technology, product manufacturer, amd)

In the world of PC gaming, AMD and Nvidia dominate the graphics card market. Whether it's a custom computer or a pre-built model, a graphics card is essential for rendering games in high quality, and cards from either Nvidia or AMD are what you'll find in all of the best gaming PCs and best gaming laptops.

Both brands offer a range of graphics cards with entry-level models starting at around $270 and high-end cards costing $1,500 or more. AMD and Nvidia also allow other manufacturers to sell third-party versions of their cards based on their original specs. This can create price variations among models with similar capabilities, since third-party manufacturers may add features like extra fans or lighting.

While there are lots of graphics cards to choose from, it's still possible to compare each brand's overall performance in relation to their price. Premium Nvidia graphics cards are typically viewed as the most powerful when it comes to advanced features, while the best AMD cards have a reputation for being significantly more affordable and energy efficient.

Below, we've broken down details on all the latest graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD, and compare how they stack up.

AMD vs. Nvidia: Price and features

AMD and Nvidia both offer a range of graphics cards for different budgets and performance needs. Nvidia's current lineup is called the GeForce RTX 40 series, while AMD's lineup is called the Radeon RX 7000 series. Here's a rundown of each series.

Note: The cards listed below are for desktop computers. Both brands also make mobile versions of their cards that PC manufacturers can integrate into their gaming laptops, but performance may vary.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the company's most powerful graphics card. Nvidia

Nvidia's RTX 40 series debuted in fall 2022 with the release of the flagship GeForce RTX 4080 ($1,199) and the premium RTX 4090 ($1,599); four more affordable RTX 40 series cards arrived in 2023.

RTX 40 series cards share a wide range of features, including raytracing, an advanced lighting feature that requires a compatible graphics card, and DLSS 3.0, the latest version of Nvidia's AI-enhanced upscaling technology that makes games easier to run at high frame rates.

Other Nvidia features are designed to benefit content creators; RTX cards include support for AI-based noise removal for your microphone and virtual backgrounds for your webcam, as well as face tracking and auto-focus. However, AMD reports that its graphics cards actually render video faster than the RTX 40 series with common editing programs like Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve Studio.

AMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards

An AMD Radeon RX 7000 series card being used with an AMD Ryzen CPU. XFX

AMD launched the Radeon RX 7000 series of graphics cards in December 2022 with the RX 7900 XT ($899) and 7900 XTX ($999), followed by the release of several lower priced cards in 2023, including the 7700XT and 7800XT which are set to launch on September 6.

AMD cards offer similar performance to Nvidia cards in most games, and usually for a lower price. For example, Tom's Hardware ranks the RX 7900 XT ($999) ahead of the RTX 4080 ($1,199) in terms of overall performance, despite the AMD card typically being $200 cheaper. However, Nvidia cards tend to reveal bigger advantages when you play newer games with more advanced graphical features.

Like the RTX 40 series, AMD's RX 7000 cards do feature ray tracing, but ray tracing performance generally lags behind the RTX 40 series with slower frame rates. The RX 7000 series also has an AI-based rendering feature to improve frame rates, called FSR, but it's not quite as developed as Nvidia's DLSS.

If you're looking to play newer releases like Cyberpunk 2077 or Allen Wake 2, a weaker AMD card may struggle to deliver graphics at the highest possible quality. That said, AMD does partner with some developers to boost performance on AMD hardware; for example, Microsoft's Starfield was designed with support for AMD's FSR at release, but not DLSS.

AMD also supports a feature called Smart Access Memory to improve performance when you pair its latest CPUs and GPUs together. This feature allows the CPU to use more of the graphics card's memory. However, some Nvidia and Intel hardware can take advantage of a similar feature, called Resizable Bar, so the underlying tech isn't AMD exclusive.

AMD benchmark data that shows RX 7000 graphics cards outperforming Nvidia hardware exclusively use AMD processors during testing, so if you have an Intel processor, you may want to look at publicly sourced benchmarks before buying an AMD card.

*The target resolution and refresh rates for each graphics card were determined based on benchmarks shared by Nvidia, AMD, and crowd sourced data from the public. The maximum frame rate and resolution possible with each card will vary based on the game.

AMD vs. Nvidia: Which graphics card should you choose?

Ultimately, choosing between an AMD or Nvidia graphics card comes down to your personal needs, budget, and preferences. Those building their own PC with a smaller budget may prefer the affordability of AMD graphics cards, while those willing to pay more to play brand-new games with graphics that can best the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X will likely want an Nvidia 4080 or 4090 card to maximize performance.

Of course, high-end AMD cards like the RX 7900 XT or RX 7900 XTX are still capable of playing the latest releases, but Nvidia's top models have an edge when you enable advanced features like ray tracing.

FAQs

What should you know before buying a graphics card?

Before you buy any graphics card, you should make sure that it's a good fit for your computer. Using an older CPU or motherboard with a brand-new graphics card can limit your overall performance and create bottlenecks that prevent you from getting the most out of your card.

Check that your motherboard supports the latest specifications, like PCIe 4.0. Newer graphics cards also demand lots of power, so make sure your power supply has enough juice to keep your computer running.

Finally, always measure the inside of your case to make sure the graphics card will physically fit during installation, as different cases can position the graphics card at different angles. Different manufacturers also make different sized versions of the same graphics card to add extra fans or lighting.","(amd, product manufacturer, graphics card)

"We weren’t expecting to hear much about AMD’s graphics cards in January, but a new rumor suggests we’ll see a new GPU in just a few weeks. AMD is prepping the RX 7600 XT, according to Benchlife’s sources (via VideoCardz). It’s apparently an updated version of AMD’s budget-focused RX 7600, sporting more VRAM and perhaps a better die.

To understand the rumored card, we have to look at the RX 7600 we already have. It’s an 8GB graphics card based on the Navi 33 GPU. The card already maxes out the capabilities of the GPU with 32 Compute Units (CUs), equaling 2,048 cores. If AMD is preparing an RX 7600 XT, there are two possibilities. Either it will use the same maxed-out Navi 33 GPU or a stripped-down version of the Navi 32 GPU we see in cards like the RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT. Hopefully, the latter is true. Although the RX 7600 is a solid 1080p graphics card, it remains about 30% slower than the next step up in AMD’s lineup.

Recommended Videos

The rumors strongly suggest an upgrade to the memory spec. The RX 7600 uses 8GB of memory on a 128-bit bus, while the XT version is rumored to come either with 10GB on a 160-bit bus or 12GB on a 192-bit bus. That extra VRAM could make a big difference in demanding titles like The Last of Us Part One, where the base RX 7600 performs poorly due to its memory interface.

Although the RX 7600 XT is rumored to launch next month, we might not see it at CES. Current speculation says AMD will announce the card on January 22 and release it on January 24. This aligns with what we’ve heard about Nvidia’s RTX 40-series Super refresh, rumored to release throughout January.

If the RX 7600 XT is real, it’s an interesting counter to Nvidia’s rumored Super refresh. Based on reports we’ve seen so far, Nvidia is prepping an RTX 4080, RTX 4070 Ti, and RTX 4070 for its Super refresh, all of which are cards above the $500 mark. The RX 7600 XT will likely sit around $300 with far lower performance. It might be a case of AMD competing in a space where Nvidia doesn’t have strong answers, as the existing RTX 4060 was a rather disappointing release for Team Green.

There’s a lot we still don’t know about the RX 7600 XT, however. Leakers are only pinning down a January announcement and the memory configuration for now, so we’ll have to wait to see what else AMD has to share about the card. AMD has confirmed it will be at CES this year, but it hasn’t announced a formal event or keynote. It may hold the announcement of the RX 7600 XT, if the card is real at all, until after the CES rush is over.

"Key Takeaways Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) on Wednesday is to launch its latest chip designed for artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

The launch event could feature a comparison with competing Nvidia products and an appearance from Microsoft, Wedbush analysts said in a research report.

The new AI chip could allow AMD to better compete with Nvidia, with Jefferies analysts naming the two chipmakers as ""top picks.""

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) is set to unveil its latest chip designed to power artificial intelligence (AI) systems on Wednesday, a move that could help the chipmaker compete with Nvidia (NVDA) amid the AI boom.

The company is to launch the Instinct MI300 data center graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerator, at Wednesday's AMD ""Advancing AI"" event. Alongside the new AI chip, AMD says it will ""highlight the company's growing momentum with AI hardware and software partners.""

AMD previously said it anticipates that MI300 will generate $2 billion in sales in 2024.

At the event, AMD could compare the capabilities of its new MI300 chip with Nvidia's H100, specifically highlighting memory content and bandwidth, Wedbush Securities analysts said in a Tuesday research note.

Nvidia, one of AMD's top competitors, has been touted as one of the ""best positioned"" companies to gain up to 80% market share from the AI craze, according to Jefferies LLC analysis.

Nvidia announced its latest and most powerful GPU, the H200, designed for use in AI, last month, although reports published in late November said that the chipmaker would delay the release of its new AI chip to 2024 due to server maker integration issues. The Nvidia chip delay comes amid investor concerns that U.S. restrictions on chip exports to China are a significant risk to Nvidia.

Microsoft (MSFT) could be involved in the AMD event, Wedbush suggested in its report, as the tech giant already announced that it will add AMD's new chip to Azure, its cloud computing segment.

Wedbush analysts have written that AMD could benefit from future growth driven by its present AI investments, while Nvidia ""alone is likely to realize"" a sales boost from an AI chip ""over the intermediate term,"" compared with its competing chip makers.

Jefferies analysts noted that with the launch of the MI300 chip, AMD is a ""top pick,"" alongside Nvidia, as the firm holds a ""positive view"" on U.S. AI chipmakers in 2024.



AMD shares, which have gained 85% this year, were down 0.3% in late trading on Tuesday.

"Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) has acquired Mipsology, an artificial intelligence (AI) software company focused on computer interpretations and responses to photos and videos.

Key Takeaways Mipsology is focused on ""image inference computation,"" or how a computer interprets and responds to visual input like a photo or a video.

The French AI company's flagship Zebra software can be deployed in autonomous vehicles, robotic manufacturing and smart retail, among other use cases.

AMD has been particularly focused on AI this year, announcing a new GPU for artificial intelligence in June.

The Palaiseau, France-headquartered Mipsology was founded in 2015 and its ""flagship"" Zebra AI software ""will help accelerate AMD solutions for AI workloads,"" according to a statement from the company.

Zebra is software that customers can deploy on preexisting hardware, though Mipsology has experience tailoring and optimizing for AMD components. Potential use cases range from autonomous vehicles and manufacturing robotics to smart retail and responsive traffic lights.

The acquisition is just the latest salvo in the chipmaker's larger artificial intelligence campaign as it competes with Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Intel Corporation (INTC).

Last week, AMD Senior Vice President Scott Herkelman said in a tweet the company would make ""major product announcements"" this week at Gamescom 2023 in Germany, likely indicating a new graphics chip. Earlier in August, AMD said it was looking to develop AI chips for the Chinese market in order to comply with U.S. export controls. Both Nvidia and Intel had previously announced their intention to do the same.

Back in June, AMD unveiled the MI300X, a new AI chip the company has touted as its ""most-advanced GPU for artificial intelligence.""

"You’ve obviously heard of the Steam Deck, and perhaps Asus drew your attention to the upcoming ROG Ally with its not-an-April-Fools’-joke. But that’s apparently just the tip of the iceberg for AMD-powered Steam Deck rivals, which have at least four handhelds based on slivers of silicon the chipmaker has yet to reveal.

One of the reasons we got so excited about the Asus ROG Ally is that Asus hinted it might be the first handheld since Steam Deck to offer a custom part specifically tuned for portables — and a growing body of leaks suggests that collaboration with AMD is called the Ryzen Z1.

And today, Geekbench leaks (which should always be taken with a grain of salt) suggest Asus may actually be using two such chips: a six-core, 12-thread Ryzen Z1 with two RDNA 3 graphics compute units (CUs) and an eight-core, 16-thread Ryzen Z1 Extreme with six RNDA3 CUs, which could have higher performance and power consumption.

But get this. A shipping manifest spotted by VideoCardz also shows an ROG Ally with another unannounced name: the Ryzen 7 7840U, a 3.3GHz chip with Radeon 780M graphics that’s suspected to be all but identical to that Z1 Extreme.

And that Ryzen 7 7840U appears to be very much not exclusive to Asus — it has now been tipped for the Aokzoe A1 Pro, an unannounced Ayaneo 2S, and a GPD Win Mini clamshell, according to rumors and leaks.

This wouldn’t be the first time those boutique portable PC makers have attempted to challenge the Steam Deck. A year ago, I wrote how they were all gearing up with the off-the-shelf AMD 6800U laptop chip, which sadly didn’t turn out to be efficient enough for a competent portable. (Read my Ayaneo 2 review for details.)

But Aokzoe, at least, seems pretty confident that it can match the Steam Deck with a 7840U: it’s been posting video after video of its A1 Pro’s performance to YouTube, including one tiny clip where the A1 Pro is running the same game at the same processor wattage and with similar battery drain to the Steam Deck and still manages to run notably faster.

If that’s what a 7840U can do, I’m heartened. (It wouldn’t be too much of a surprise considering we’re looking at Zen 4 and RDNA 3 instead of the Zen 2 and RDNA 2 in the Steam Deck’s Aerith chip.)

But it’s just a tiny glimpse for now, and we don’t know whether any of these companies can hit the right price with these chips or get Microsoft’s help to turn Windows into something easy and comfortable to use on a gaming handheld. And AMD didn’t immediately respond to a request for this story.

Another thing that heartens me, though:

Last July, when I reached out to my AMD PR contacts about handheld gaming PCs, they told me they didn’t even have a contact who could handle such a request, adding:

We do not have any further details to share at this time regarding AMD chips in handheld gaming PCs. We’ll certainly be in touch with news and opportunities as it relates to AMD in the future but unfortunately at this time are not able to connect you directly.","(technology, product manufacturer, asus)

"AMD's Radeon RX 7000-series graphics cards released to date have brought fierce competition to Nvidia and its GeForce RTX 40-series GPUs. You've likely noticed, though, a massive hole in AMD’s product lineup, with nothing between the $269 AMD Radeon RX 7600 and the $899 AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT. That this state of affairs has gone on for as long as it has is astonishing. But it was likely worth the wait, as the AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT and Radeon RX 7800 XT are both exceptional new GPUs. In this review, we’ll focus on the $499 Radeon RX 7800 XT, and it's a winner. Its price and currently unmatched performance give it a dominant position in its slice of the graphics card market, earning it an Editors' Choice award for 1440p GPUs.

Architecture: With Navi 32, the Chiplets Are Back

When AMD introduced its line of Radeon RX 7000-series graphics cards, it called out three technologies as core components of the new design. First was its new microarchitecture, known as ""RDNA 3,"" and second was a new manufacturing process. Both of these were expected, as such changes happen almost every generation. I covered them in my launch review of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

The third technology is the fresh chiplet design, which debuted in the first AMD Radeon RX 7000-series graphics cards. Chiplets don't underpin every Radeon RTX 7000-series card, though. After releasing the chiplet-based Radeon RX 7900 XTX and the similar Radeon RX 7900 XT, AMD next released the Radeon RX 7600 with a monolithic chip design. That raised the question of what future cards in the line would look like. Now, we have our answer.

The Radeon RX 7800 XT is built on a chiplet design akin to the one used in the RX 7900 XTX and the RX 7900 XT. It's based around one large chip that is referred to as the Graphics Chip Die (GCD). It measures 200mm2 and contains 60 compute units, giving it 62.5% as many resources as the GCD in the 7900 XTX.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

As for cache, the RX 7800 XT also comes with four Memory Cache Dies (MCDs) that measure roughly 37mm2 each, for a total combined area of about 150mm2. Each of these MCDs supports a 64-bit memory interface and 16MB of L2 cache, giving the RX 7800 XT an aggregate 256-bit memory interface and 64MB of L2 cache. AMD fitted the card out with 16GB of GDDR6 memory that operates at 19.5Gbps, enabling 624GBps of total bandwidth. All of this is about two-thirds of what’s available on the Radeon RX 7900 XTX.

For a more detailed breakdown of the number of ray accelerators, AI accelerators, TMUs, ROPs, and shaders, please see the chart above. Often when we see a drop in the amount of resources, we see a slight increase in clock speed to partially make up for the disparity in shaders. We do not see this with the Radeon RX 7800 XT and instead see a slight drop in clock speed. It tops out at a boost clock of 2,430MHz, compared with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX’s boost of 2,500MHz.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

While all of these reductions make the RX 7800 XT look slower than the 7900 XTX—on paper, and in benchmarks—this is only half of the story. If we take price into consideration, the RX 7800 XT is the most alluring product in AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 series.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

Put simply, at $499, the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT costs half as much as the RX 7900 XTX, while packing roughly two-thirds of its resources. This equates to better overall value-per-dollar, and it places the RX 7800 XT in a competitive position in the graphics card market.

AMD's Reference Design and FSR 3

For review, AMD sent us a Radeon RX 7800 XT based on its internally developed reference design. This card is equipped with two internal eight-pin PCIe power connections, and it has three DisplayPort connectors and an HDMI port on its rear I/O panel. The reference card employs a dual-fan thermal solution that's just a bit wider than a standard dual-slot card.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

Before I move on to testing, I have one last key detail to address: FSR 3. AMD developed FSR 3 in response to Nvidia’s DLSS 3 technology, and it works in a similar way: by generating artificial frames between existing frames to boost overall frame rates.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

This feature was introduced alongside the RX 7800 XT, but I have little to say about it at this time. AMD hasn’t shared explicit details (yet) about how this technology works, though it is an open technology and can work with a wide range of graphics cards—from AMD, or otherwise.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

Though FSR 3 will be available to everyone soon, AMD was not able to provide us with early access to the game files required to test FSR 3 for this review. We’ll need to investigate this feature at a later date.

AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT: Our Test Setup

Our test system for graphics cards is built on an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard with a stock-clocked Intel Core i9-12900K processor actively cooled by a Corsair Hydro Series H100X water cooler. This lot is paired with 32GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM clocked at 5,600MHz, and a 1TB Corsair MP600 Pro NVMe 4.0 SSD for storage. Power is provided by a Corsair HX1500i power supply that is rated 80 Plus Platinum efficient and can supply up to 1,500 watts of power to the system at any given time. All tests were performed inside of Windows 11 Pro with the latest updates installed.

The pricing dynamics of the graphics card market have been turbulent in recent years, which makes it difficult to describe the Radeon RX 7800 XT's exact position at launch. It has the characteristics of a midrange graphics card, which better fits the likes of the RX 7600 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060. It's also not a flagship card and is vastly different from the ""high end"" graphics cards we were introduced to at the initial launch of the Radeon RX 7000 and GeForce RTX 40 families. Calling the RX 7800 XT a high-end card still fits best, though high-end has never quite felt so close to the middle.

In its position as a high-end but not top-end graphics card, the RX 7800 XT comes into closest competition with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, which occupies a similar tier in the graphics card market. However, this too feels like an awkward comparison: Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4070 cards start at $599, making that GPU line clearly more expensive than the $499 RX 7800 XT.

As for pricing, the $499 Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB is a better match, but that card and the lesser 8GB RTX 4060 Ti have some notable shortcomings that weaken their position against the RX 7800 XT. (Nvidia points out that a few specific base-model versions of the 16GB RTX 4060 Ti are selling for under MSRP, at $449—which was true at this writing, but most of the 16GB cards were still $500 or more.) All told, the RX 7800 XT undercuts the RTX 4060 Ti line, and with resources that are on a closer level to the RTX 4070's.

Determining exactly how these cards compare is what we have benchmark testing for, of course. But the specs and pricing suggest that the Radeon RX 7800 XT represents one of the best values we've seen in quite some time in the graphics card world. Let's see if that bears out.

Synthetic Tests

Synthetic tests allow us to gauge a graphics processor’s raw performance, but they can never tell the full story. Both 3DMark and Furmark show about what we would expect to see, with the RX 7800 XT results coming in fairly close to the RTX 4070, which was still a clear step ahead in all but a few subtests.

LuxMark tests the compute performance of graphics cards, and that test showed an even greater advantage for the RTX 4070. It’s only in Unigine's Superposition trial that we saw the RX 7800 XT pull back a bit, coming to a near dead-even tie with the RTX 4070 in the DirectX 11 test and slightly surpassing it when OpenGL is used.

Ray Tracing, FSR, and DLSS Game Testing

AMD’s graphics cards are at their deepest disadvantage when it comes to games that support ray tracing. Nvidia has placed a greater emphasis on boosting ray-tracing performance than AMD has up to this point, but even with that advantage, it’s still not an open-and-shut case for Nvidia in ray-tracing games.

In our first ray-tracing game test (using F1 22), the Radeon RX 7800 XT was able to beat out the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti by roughly 13% at 1080p and about 31% at 4K. It didn’t fare quite as well against the RTX 4070, which surpassed the Radeon RX 7800 XT by as much as 12%. That changed with FSR 1.0 and DLSS 2.0 enabled, handing the advantage back to the RX 7800 XT. DLSS 3 enables the RTX 4070 to pull ahead again, but only at 1440p.

In Cyberpunk 2077, we saw much the same results as in F1 22, with the Radeon RX 7800 XT outperforming the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti and slightly behind the GeForce RTX 4070 with FSR and DLSS off. We didn’t test this game with DLSS 2, but with DLSS 3 even the significantly slower GeForce RTX 4060 was able to pull ahead of the Radeon RX 7800 XT.

Guardians of the Galaxy has shown a preference for Nvidia-based graphics cards, and we typically see Nvidia cards perform significantly better in this test. Despite this inherent disadvantage, the Radeon RX 7800 XT performed quite well in this test. It was only slightly behind the RTX 4060 Ti in this test at 1080p. The two cards then tied at 1440p, and the RX 7800 XT pulled ahead for a slim 2fps advantage at 4K. The RX 7800 XT had no chance of touching the RTX 4070 this time, however.

When Driver Issues Get in the Way

Out of all of the tests I ran, the most disappointing result is one that’s not shown here. I’ve been testing graphics cards with Returnal as I slowly weave it into the standard array of graphics cards tests I use. I’ve never had an issue with this test or game, even while using Intel’s Arc graphics cards—until now.

In what can only be a driver issue, AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT crashed every time I attempted to run Returnal. This was unique to the RX 7800 XT and did not affect any other Radeon cards I put through this test, including the RX 7700 XT, the RX 7600, and the RX 7900 XTX.

Though this gives a poor first impression, it’s necessary to temper any reaction to this issue. The volume of games on the market, even if you just count the ones considered modern AAA titles, is enormous. We expect all of these games to run flawlessly on new hardware, but realistically glitches slip through, which is why we have driver updates. I’m sure that AMD will fix this issue at some point before long, but it is nevertheless disappointing to see from an otherwise class-leading product.

AAA Game Testing

In games that don’t support ray tracing, the GeForce RTX 40-series cards lose one of their greatest advantages, giving AMD's Radeon RX 7800 XT an ever greater chance to shine.

Without ray tracing, the RX 7800 XT was predictably able to run circles around the RTX 4060 Ti in Total War: Three Kingdoms, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Far Cry 5. The one exception to this was in Far Cry 5 at 1080p, which has shown irregular results likely due to some sort of bottleneck on the processor or game engine. At 1440p and 4K, however, the RX 7800 XT was far faster than the RTX 4060 Ti in Far Cry 5, too.

Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4070 didn't score a clean win here. Instead it traded places, with the RX 7800 XT performing better in Total War: Three Kingdoms and the RTX 4070 retorting with wins in the other two games.

Legacy Games Testing

Older games are often challenging for newer graphics cards—not because they lack the performance to run the games, but because these games receive less modern driver support, which can result in reduced performance or even cause games to fail to run.

We can’t raise any criticism on AMD in this area, however, as all tests ran without issue and performance was overall impressive. The Radeon RX 7800 XT performed well in Bioshock Infinite, trading places with the RTX 4070 once again. In Hitman Absolution, the RX 7800 XT maintained a healthy lead over the RTX 4070 across all three test resolutions. And in Sleeping Dogs, the two cards once again traded places back and forth.

Power and Thermals

We test the power consumption of our graphics card test bed using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to gauge the power draw of each card. Only the graphics card and applicable drivers are changed between tests, giving us a decent idea of the power consumption of each card, if not an exact measurement.

Power consumption is one area in which AMD has room to improve relative to its Nvidia competition. The GeForce RTX 4070 performed on a competitive footing with the Radeon RX 7800 XT, but the RTX 4070 had notably lower power consumption numbers in all areas except the idle power draw. The RTX 4060 Ti’s power consumption numbers were even lower.

Thermal readings were also higher for the Radeon RX 7800 XT card, which was somewhat disappointing as the RX 7900 XT fared significantly better in this area. This suggests the cooler was responsible for the lackluster temp readings on the RX 7800 XT, as it has a less robust thermal solution than the RX 7900 XT's. This situation could be significantly better on some cards made by AMD’s board partners, with some cards perhaps outfitted with more-robust cooling schemes. But for now, all we can do is speculate on that front.

We should be clear, however, that the thermal readings on the RX 7800 XT weren’t terrible. The 69 degrees C thermal reading is well within the safe operating range for the card and acceptable for continuous use.

Verdict: AMD's Best Effort of the 7000s

Though the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT ran a little warm and used a bit more power than we may have liked, it’s hard for us to fault the card for this or on any other front. Price and performance are always the most important factors for desktop components, and the Radeon RX 7800 XT excels at both.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

When discussing components, it’s necessary to take a broader look to understand a product's place in the market. Sometimes, we can let the numbers speak for themselves: The Radeon RX 7800 XT best compares with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4070 in terms of performance, but the RX 7800 XT costs $100 less. When the performance is so frequently on a near-even footing or possibly even better on the cheaper card, what reason do you have to buy the more expensive one? Sure, the RTX 4070 is occasionally faster, but neither consistently nor overwhelmingly, and even in those cases the speed spread still isn’t enough to justify the added expense.

The second-closest competing Nvidia graphics card to the Radeon RX 7800 XT is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, but if anything, that comparison looks much worse for Nvidia here. The RTX 4060 Ti has an MSRP of $399 for cards that ship with 8GB of GDDR6 RAM, and cards with 16GB of RAM are $499-plus (with the exception of the few basic $449 models). Even pitted against the 16GB GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, the RX 7800 XT remains the more attractive deal.

Indeed, AMD's Radeon RX 7800 XT is significantly faster than the 8GB RTX 4060 Ti in almost every test, and in this case the performance difference is more than sufficient to justify the $100 premium. This situation only worsens if you look closely at tests running at 1440p and 4K, as the 8GB RTX 4060 Ti is held back by a limited memory interface that cramps its performance above 1080p. This is why Nvidia markets the 8GB card for 1080p play...but $399 is rather much for that level of play.

Due to this limitation, the performance advantage held by the Radeon RX 7800 XT over the RTX 4060 Ti only increases as the resolution goes up. The RX 7800 XT does not suffer from any such handicap, and if you needed any more reason to opt for the RX 7800 XT over the RTX 4060 Ti, this should be it.

What about AMD's competition from within its own house? With two-thirds the resources at half the price of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, the RX 7800 XT is clearly a better value than AMD’s flagship on a per-dollar basis. It even edges out the Radeon RX 7600 with a slightly lower price per compute unit, and that’s not even considering the improved memory system on the RX 7800 XT.

To sweeten the deal further, AMD now (at the time of writing) includes a copy of Starfield: Premium Edition with all Radeon RX 7800 XT graphics cards at launch. This version of the game, which includes an expansion to the base game along with a skin pack and access to digital art and original soundtracks, retails for $99.99 — not a bad deal at all.

Everything you see here suggests that the Radeon RX 7800 XT will be AMD's best graphics card of this generation, earning it our Editors' Choice award for 1440p gaming. Until Nvidia adjusts its prices, or releases a new card to combat it, the Radeon RX 7800 XT stands as the only graphics card worth recommending between the $299 Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and the $899 AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT for the foreseeable future.

"Lisa Su displays an AMD Instinct MI300 chip as she delivers a keynote address at CES 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 4, 2023.

AMD said on Tuesday its most-advanced GPU for artificial intelligence, the MI300X, will start shipping to some customers later this year.

AMD's announcement represents the strongest challenge to Nvidia , which currently dominates the market for AI chips with over 80% market share, according to analysts.

GPUs are chips used by firms like OpenAI to build cutting-edge AI programs such as ChatGPT.

If AMD's AI chips, which it calls ""accelerators,"" are embraced by developers and server makers as substitutes for Nvidia's products, it could represent a big untapped market for the chipmaker, which is best known for its traditional computer processors.

AMD CEO Lisa Su told investors and analysts in San Francisco on Tuesday that AI is the company's ""largest and most strategic long-term growth opportunity.""

""We think about the data center AI accelerator [market] growing from something like $30 billion this year, at over 50% compound annual growth rate, to over $150 billion in 2027,"" Su said.

While AMD didn't disclose a price, the move could put price pressure on Nvidia's GPUs, such as the H100, which can cost $30,000 or more. Lower GPU prices may help drive down the high cost of serving generative AI applications.

AI chips are one of the bright spots in the semiconductor industry, while PC sales, a traditional driver of semiconductor processor sales, slump.

Last month, AMD CEO Lisa Su said on an earnings call that while the MI300X will be available for sampling this fall, it would start shipping in greater volumes next year. Su shared more details on the chip during her presentation on Tuesday.

""I love this chip,"" Su said.","(technology, product manufacturer, amd)

"Last year, AMD released its Ryzen 7 5800X3D to the market with 96 MB of L3 V-Cache. The consumer implementation of AMD's then-new 3D stacked V-Cache technology, which allowed for greatly expanding the total L3 cache available on a CPU, the 5800X3D was primarily aimed at the gaming market, where the additional 64MB of L3 cache could be uniquely useful to improving performance in CPU-bound gaming workloads. While hit-and-miss depending on the specific game at hand, in the right games and the right scenarios, the additional cache could provide a performance boost that even the highest-clocked CPUs couldn't match.

AMD's initial implementations of V-Cache in the 5800X3D and its server counterpart, Milan-X, were just the tip of the iceberg for the company. Though the benefits of this stacked cache manufacturing strategy were limited with the initial generation of products, AMD's eye has been on the long game: V-Cache is forward-looking design that will pay off with bigger dividends for AMD over time, as they'll eventually be able to produce the V-Cache dies using older and cheaper manufacturing processes, optimizing their manufacturing costs while still being able to offer what is by CPU standards an absurd amount of L3 cache. Ultimately, this multi-generational strategy for V-Cache was laid out in greater detail in AMD's 2023-2024 desktop CPU roadmap, which outlined their intention to bring it to AMD's recently launched Ryzen 7000 series chips.

That brings us to today, and the impending launch of AMD's second generation of V-Cache equipped consumer chips, the Ryzen 7000X3D family. Tomorrow morning AMD will be releasing a pair of their latest-generation Ryzen 7000 chips with the extra cache stacked on, including the Ryzen 9 7950X3D (16C/32T) and the Ryzen 7 7900X3D (12C/24T). Both chips build upon their X-series predecessors by adding a further 64MB of L3 cache, bringing them to an impressive total of 128 MB of L3 cache.

Meanwhile, a third SKU, the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, is in the works for April 6th. That part will offer 8 CPU cores and 96 MB of L3 cache, making it the most direct successor to the Ryzen 7 5800X3D.

Ultimately, all three chips will serve to update AMD's product stack by combining the strengths of the Zen 4 CPU architecture with the performance benefits of the extra L3 cache, which during the overlapping period of the last several months, has been split between the Ryzen 5000 and Ryzen 7000 families. In short, PC gamers will finally be able to have their cake and eat it too, gaining access to AMD's Zen 4 microarchitecture and its myriad of benefits (higher IPC, higher clockspeeds, DDR5, PCIe 5) with a nice helping of additional L3 cache slathered on top.

From that stack, today we're reviewing the new flagship Ryzen 9 7950X3D. The 7950X3D offers 16 Zen 4 cores spread over two CCDs (8C/16T per CCD). AMD had to elect one of the CCDs to stack the additional L3 cache onto, resulting in a new-to-AMD heterogeneous CPU design, but they do have some special sauce as a garnish to make it work. We aim to determine if the Ryzen 9 7950X3D is the chip gamers have been yearning for and how it stacks up against other Ryzen 7000 chips (and Intel's 13th Gen) in our test suite.

The Ryzen 9 7950X3D: 128 MB of L3 Cache, 16-Cores, Designed For Gamers

Up until now, we've had a wave of Ryzen 7000 series SKUs launch, including the flagship Ryzen 9 7950X and other X-series SKUs such as the Ryzen 9 7900X, Ryzen 7 7700X, and Ryzen 5 7600X, as well as their 65 W SKUs which have filled out the product stack nicely. Offering different configurations of core counts, frequencies, and ultimately price, the Ryzen 7000 stack is loaded with chips for users of all levels.



AMD's 3D V-Cache packaging slide (Zen 3): AMD uses the same method for Zen 4

These newest chips from AMD, in turn, expand the Ryzen 7000 stack further by adding a trio of parts incorporating AMD's 3D V-Cache technology. The basic idea behind 3D V-Cache is to stack additional cache memory on top of the existing processor die. The cache memory is then connected to the die using through-silicon vias (TSVs), which are vertical interconnects that pass through the silicon substrate. This allows for a much larger amount of L3 cache memory to be added to the processor without requiring that AMD mint a separate, larger CCD.

The 3D V-Cache packaging process worked well with the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, and we did see gains in frame rates across some of the games we tested; some games are memory/cache-bound, and thus can make good use of the additional L3 cache for a performance boost, while other games are unfazed by the additional cache as they are more outright compute-bound. Ultimately, the benefits of the additional cache do not make for a one-size-fits-all situation, as it varies from title to title, sometimes significantly so. As things stand, there unfortunately isn't anything quite like a whitelist of games that can benefit from the additional cache, which means the best guidance we can offer is that gamers will want to take the time to do a little extra research to see if the specific games they care about are any faster on these X3D chips.

Looking at the main specifications of the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, it has 16 Zen 4 CPUs cores and operates at a TDP rating of 120 W; this is some 50 W lower than the regular Ryzen 9 7950X. According to AMD, the more relevant Package Power Tracking (PPT) rating is 1.35x the TDP, which puts the socket power output at up to 162 W. The Ryzen 9 7950X3D also shares the same turbo frequency as the Ryzen 9 7950X, which is 5.7 GHz, but AMD has lowered the base frequency by 300 MHz, making it 4.2 GHz on the 7950X3D. Memory support remains unchanged from the rest of the Ryzen 7000 family, with JEDEC-compliant speeds topping out at DDR5-5200, while overclocking (AMD EXPO, etc) can take it over DDR5-6000.

Although we're only reviewing the Ryzen 9 7950X3D today, the two other Ryzen 7000 X3D SKUs are worth mentioning. The other SKU launching today is the Ryzen 9 7900X3D, a 12-core/24-thread part with the same 128 MB of 3D stacked L3 V-Cache. It also features a 120 W TDP/162 W PPT, and has the same 5.6 GHz turbo clock speed as the Ryzen 9 7900X. Like the differences between the Ryzen 9 7950X3D and 7950X, the base core frequency is lower on the Ryzen 9 7900X3D than its counterpart, with a base frequency of 4.4 GHz, a 200 MHz drop over the Ryzen 9 7900X.

The third SKU with 3D V-Cache is the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, which isn't available until the 6th of April, but it's still a very interesting part. Not only is it the only chip to use the 7800 model number, but it's very similar in specifications to the original Ryzen 7 5800X3D, a very successful SKU that is currently (still) the number 5 best-selling CPU on Amazon at the time of writing. Like the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, the soon-to-be-released Ryzen 7 7800X3D shares a turbo frequency of 5 GHz. The Ryzen 7 7800X3D has a 4.2 GHz base frequency, but it benefits from AMD's latest Zen 4 architecture, built upon TSMC's N5 5 nm manufacturing process. As we saw in our Ryzen 9 7950X and Ryzen 5 7600X review, AMD has boosted performance per watt efficiency and improved IPC performance nicely.

A Tale of Two CCDs: One with 3D V-Cache, One Without

The Ryzen 7000 and 5000 families are built upon a chiplet-based design, with top-end chips such as the Ryzen 9 7950X featuring two core complex dies (CCD) as well as a singular I/O die (IOD) Chips in the family with lower core counts, such as the Ryzen 7 and 5 families, typically bring this down to one active CCD (and potentially one fused-off CCD if the chip was salvaged).

With their first-generation Ryzen 7 5800X3D, AMD avoided any complexities involving mixing V-Cache with their multi-CCD designs by only ever producing X3D parts with a single CCD. However for this generation, AMD is taking the next step by making multi-CCD X3D parts available – and they aren't putting V-Cache on both CCDs.

This quandary over using two CCDs with V-Cache has raised many questions with users since AMD initially revealed their new Ryzen 7000X3D parts. The long and short of matters is that for this generation, AMD has taken steps to have the best of both worlds – to have a V-Cache-equipped CCD while also having another, unencumbered CCD in order to offer the highest compute performance.

Touching on the design of the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, AMD is employing an asymmetric chiplet design, where one of the CCDs is a vanilla Zen 4 CCD, and the other is a Zen 4 CCD with 64 MB of V-Cache stacked on. This means that the Ryzen 9 7950X3D has one CCD with 96 MB of L3 cache, while the second ""vanilla"" CCD still has the usual 32 MB available. AMD's Infinity Fabric Interconnect keeps everything flowing, which connects both CCDs to the centralized IOD in a die-to-die connect flow.

Notably, just as the two CCDs are unequal in cache, they're also unequal in peak clockspeeds. Attaching a V-Cache die to a CCD limits the highest clockspeeds it can attain, capping it at around 5.25GHz. Thus, compared to the 5.7GHz max clockspeed of a plain Zen 4 CCD (as used on the 7950X/7950X3D), this represents a roughly 8% frequency handicap for adding V-Cache. Which is why AMD is including both types of CCDs on their Ryzen 9 7000X3D parts, ensuring that applications have access to whatever type of CCD better fits their processing needs.

Ultimately, AMD states that having one CCD with V-Cache and one standard CCD provides the best balance for maximizing performance in both gaming workloads and general heavy workload compute tasks. Applications and games that can benefit from the larger pool of L3 cache can be loaded up on to the V-Cache CCD, while everything else is loaded up on the standard CCD (and growing out to the second CCD as needed).

Drivers & OS Scheduling: PPM Provisioning & V-Cache Performance Optimizer

This additional layer of complexity means that, for the first time on a consumer AMD platform, AMD's CPUs are now heterogeneous. Depending on which CCD they're on, the CPU cores within a 7950X3D are dissimilar, and that's something that needs to be taken into account when scheduling which CPU core/CCD a thread will go on. To that end, AMD has developed a pair of Windows drivers for the 7000X3D series to help the Windows scheduler more intelligently place threads on the best CCD for the task.

Under the hood, AMD is essentially hooking into Windows' Game Mode (and Mixed Reality Mode) to let the OS determine when a game is active, and then use that hint to change how Windows thread scheduling works. The resulting layers of BIOS features, Xbox Game Bar software (which controls Game Mode), and AMD's drivers add up to a complete control mechanism for allocating work on the 7950X3D and 7900X3D.

Diving into AMD's software stack, the first of AMD's drivers is the AMD PPM Provisioning Driver. This comes included within the 5.01.03.005 version (or newer) of AMD's chipset driver. This driver steers threads by parking what AMD determines is the least performant CCD, leaving only the more performant CCD initially active. This keeps all of the threads for a game on the same CCD, reducing (if not eliminating) the need to reach across the IOD to access the L3 cache on the other CCD, and thus improving the cache hit rate and resulting performance.

Technically, the PPM driver can park either CCD. But in practice it's going to virtually always be the vanilla CCD, pushing games on to the V-Cache CCD. Though should a game ask for more CPU cores (and technically, threads) than a single CCD can provide, then the PPM will allow the other CCD to go active. Parking the CCD doesn't prevent its use – so all 16 CPU cores are available – it just discourages using more than 1 CCD (8 cores) when at all possible.

Meanwhile, users can manually override this feature in their motherboard's firmware under the AMD CBS section of the Ryzen overclocking settings. While each motherboard vendor's firmware is different in design, features, and styling, changing the setting to auto can be switched to either 'cache' for workloads or games benefiting from the 3D V-Cache, or set it to 'frequency' in which it will allow the faster CCD to do the heavy lifting.

Moving on, the second of AMD's new X3D drivers is the AMD 3D V-Cache Performance Optimizer Driver. Again, this comes bundled into the chipset driver, and it operates as the counterpart to the PPM driver, changing how Windows ranks the performance of the various CPU cores.

Typically, Windows will rank CPU cores by clockspeeds, which is usually the correct way to go for physically homogenous CPU cores. Especially in the case of things like favored/preferred cores and ""prime"" CPU cores (e.g. Windows on Arm), putting heavy workloads on the fastest CPU core will net you the best performance. However having heterogeneous cores with different amounts of L3 cache changes this calculus – it's possible (and even likely) for a slower CPU core to be faster thanks to its access to a larger local L3 cache pool.



The AMD 3D V-Cache Performance Optimizer Driver working in the background

The net result, then, is that the 3D V-Cache Performance Optimizer Driver will change Windows' performance rankings when Game Mode is active so that Windows will try to use the CPU cores on the V-Cache CCD first. Coupled with the PPM driver, these two techniques are how AMD will try to ensure that games and their threads are sent to the V-Cache CCD first, while everything else continues to favor the traditional, higher-clocked CCD.



Ryzen 9 7950X3D automatically detecting Total War: Warhammer 3 as a game in Xbox Game Bar

Finally it's worth highlighting that Game Mode within Windows 11/10 must be enabled for the AMD PPM and Performance Optimizer drivers to work seamlessly. AMD states that the Ryzen 7000X3D chips and their associated software stack will work under both Windows 10 (1903 or later) and Windows 11 (21H2 or later). But AMD pretty strongly recommends users go with Windows 11, as if nothing else, there are some potential cosmetic reporting bugs that remain on Windows 10 when Virtualization Based Security (VBS) is enabled. Meanwhile VBS is an outright requirement on Windows 11.

Ryzen 9 7950X3D: No Unlocked Multiplier, But Supports Curve Optimizer, Precision Boost Overdrive, and AMD EXPO Memory

AMD, with its Ryzen 7000 65 W processors, showed impressive power-to-performance efficiency compared with its existing Ryzen 7000 chips. AMD is looking to show off its capabilities further while drawing less power. Of course,

Unlike AMD's regular X-series SKUs, The Ryzen 9 7950X3D does not have an unlocked multiplier; meaning manually overclocking the cores is disabled. But the chip does still benefit from some of AMD's overclocking technology. While the Ryzen 7 5800X3D was limited to memory overclocking, the Ryzen 9 7950X3D has AMD's Curve Optimizer and Precision Boost Overdrive enabled. The Curve Optimizer allows users an easy one-click option to at least, in theory, deliver a boost to core performance. This can be enabled in AMD's Ryzen Master overclocking utility, while AMD's Precision Boost Overdrive can also be enabled similarly.

Memory overclocking is also still available on these X3D SKUs. This goes for both manual overclocking, and using EXPO memory profiles on memory kits that come with those overclocking profiles. There are numerous EXPO-enabled kits on the market right now, especially from Corsair and G.Skill. And even XMP kits work to an extent, though their timings may not be ideal for AMD's Ryzen 7000 series processors.

For a more detailed analysis of our AMD Ryzen 7000 (Zen 4) coverage, here are a few links with a more in-depth look at the Zen 4 core architecture, as well as AMD's AM5 platform:

From a marketing point of view, the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D is primarily aimed at gamers, particularly those who play games that can make good use of the additional L3 cache. When we reviewed the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, we found it lacking a little in compute tasks when directly compared to the regular Ryzen 7 5800X due to lower core frequencies and a lock on turbo frequencies. The flip side is that we saw some of the benefits of AMD's 3D V-Cache stacking technology in gaming, making it a purchase better suited for gamers in particular, rather than the broader performance enthusiast market.

AMD is looking to change that perception somewhat with its Ryzen 7000X3D SKUs, thanks to higher overall clockspeeds and the use of heterogeneous (asymmetrical) CPU cores. Thus we expect less of a hit on compute performance with these due to still combining decent levels of frequencies, and specifications, albeit, at a lower PPT power rating of 162 W.

From a pricing point of view, AMD has priced the Ryzen 9 7950X3D at what was the original MSRP of the Ryzen 9 7950X: $699. This makes the flagship X3D chip around $110 more expensive than the 7950X, which these days can be snagged for $589. For the other chips, the Ryzen 9 7900X3D ($599) is $150 more expensive than the Ryzen 9 7900X (currently $449), while the Ryzen 7 7800X3D will cost $449 when it releases in April.



The Ryzen 9 7950X3D in retail packaging: Ready to cook up

Finally, taking a look at the competitive landscape, AMD is aiming the Ryzen 9 7950X3D more at the Core i9-13900K in gaming than its Ryzen 9 7950X counterpart. So it's time to put it on our test bench, put it through its paces in our test suite, and see how well the Ryzen 9 7950X3D fares against the competition. Compute performance enthusiasts will likely find that the Ryzen 9 7950X is still an overall better chip; whereas the Ryzen 9 7950X3D is looking to leverage its 128 MB of L3 cache in games to make it the best gaming chip on the market. Let's see what we're dealing with.

The Current CPU Test Suite

For our AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D testing, we are using the following test system:

"AMD has released its latest generation of high-performance processors aimed at the high-end desktop (HEDT) market, the Ryzen Threadripper 7000 series. These new chips mark AMD’s return to the HEDT segment after skipping it in the previous 5000 series.

According to a recent Andandtech report, the new Threadripper 7000 lineup includes the flagship 7980X with 64 cores and 128 threads, the 7970X with 32 cores and 64 threads, and the 7960X with 24 cores and 48 threads. All three models are built on AMD’s latest Zen 4 architecture and 5nm manufacturing process, bringing significant jumps in performance and efficiency compared to previous generation Threadripper processors.

The top-of-the-line 7980X has a base clock of 2.5GHz and turbo clock reaching up to 5.1GHz. It offers 48 lanes of PCIe Gen 5 connectivity and supports quad-channel DDR5 memory with up to 1TB capacity when using RDIMMs. The 7980X is tailored for extreme multitasking scenarios and workloads that can leverage a high core count, like 3D rendering, video editing, code compilation, and scientific computing.

The 32-core 7970X ramps up the base clock speed to 3.2GHz while matching the 7980X’s 5.1GHz boost frequency. It retains the same PCIe and memory support, providing an ideal middle-ground between performance and price at $2499.

7960X dials back the core count to 24 but enables an even higher turbo clock of 5.3GHz

Finally, the most affordable 7960X dials back the core count to 24 but enables an even higher turbo clock of 5.3GHz, starting from a 3.2GHz base clock. With a price of $1499, it delivers significantly more performance than mainstream desktop chips for users focused on memory bandwidth and I/O rather than raw multi-threaded throughput.

All three new Threadripper processors are drop-in compatible with existing sTRX4 coolers but require beefy cooling with their high 350W TDPs. They are supported by AMD’s new TRX50 platform and chipset, offering 48 PCIe 5.0 lanes plus 32 PCIe 4.0 lanes.

By bringing Zen 4 architecture to the HEDT market, AMD aims to deliver no-compromise desktop performance for the most demanding professional use cases spanning content creation, visual effects, scientific research, and more. The company is positioning Threadripper 7000 chips against Intel Xeon workstation processors while out-muscling the best available mainstream desktop CPUs.

With strong multi-threaded performance and vastly increased I/O bandwidth, the return of Threadripper establishes AMD as the only option for users needing more computing power than even the top-tier Ryzen 9 desktop chips can provide. While niche, the extreme performance capabilities of the 7000 series cement HEDT as a viable path forward for select ultra-enthusiasts and professional power users alike.

"We’re almost done with 2023, and as ever at TechRadar, it’s time to look back at how the various tech giants performed over the past year. In AMD’s case, we saw some inspiring new products introduced for its consumer processor and GPU ranges, and renewed gusto in its pursuit of AI.

There were also shakier times for Team Red, though, notably a string of blunders – the vapor chamber cooling debacle is one that springs immediately to mind, but there were other incidents, and a few too many of them. Join us as we explore the ups and downs of AMD’s 2023, weighing everything up at the end.

Zen 4 gets 3D V-Cache

One of AMD’s big moves this year was the introduction of 3D V-Cache for AMD’s Ryzen 7000 desktop processors.

There were a trio of X3D models introduced, with the higher-end Ryzen 9 7950X3D and 7900X3D hitting the shelves first in February. These were good CPUs and we liked them, particularly the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, which is a sterling processor, albeit very pricey (similarly, we felt the price of the 7900X3D held it back somewhat).

What everyone was really waiting for, though, was the more affordable mid-range 3D V-Cache chip, and the Ryzen 7 7800X3D turned up in April. We praised the 7800X3D’s outstanding gaming performance and it’s the best choice for a gaming PC as we conclude in our roundup of the best processors. This was a definite highlight in AMD’s releases this year.

We were also treated to an interesting diversion in the form of a new last-gen X3D processor which AMD chose a very different tactic for. The Ryzen 5 5600X3D arrived in July as a cheap CPU that’s great for an affordable gaming PC, the catch being that it only went on sale through Micro Center stores in the US. For those who couldn’t get that, though, there was always the old Ryzen 5800X3D which dipped to some really low price tags at various points throughout the year. For gamers, AMD had some tempting pricing, that’s for sure.

Away from the world of 3D V-Cache, AMD also pushed out a few vanilla Ryzen 7000 CPUs right at the start of the year, namely the Ryzen 9 7900, Ryzen 7 7700, and Ryzen 5 7600, the siblings of the already released ‘X’ versions of these processors. They were useful choices to be thrown into the mix offering a bit more affordability for the Zen 4 range.

RDNA 3 arrives for real

AMD unleashed its RDNA 3 graphics cards right at the close of 2022, but only the top-tier models, the Radeon RX 7900 series. And the RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT were all we had until 2023 was surprisingly far along – it wasn’t until May that the RX 7600 pitched up at the other end of the GPU spectrum.

The RX 7600 very much did its job as a wallet-friendly graphics card, mind you, and this GPU seriously impressed us with its outstanding performance at 1080p and excellent value proposition overall. Indeed, the RX 7600 claimed the title of our best cheap graphics card for this year, quite an achievement, beating out Nvidia’s RTX 4060.

Then we had another sizeable pause – which witnessed gamers getting rather impatient – for the gap, or rather gulf, to be filled in between the RX 7600 and RX 7900 models. Enter stage left the RX 7800 XT and the 7700 XT as mid-range contenders in September, one of which really punched its weight.

(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)

That was the RX 7800 XT and even though it only marginally outdid its predecessor for pure performance, this new RDNA 3 mid-ranger did so well in terms of its price/performance ratio versus its RTX 4070 rival that the AMD GPU scooped the coveted top spot in our best graphics card roundup. (Deposing the RTX 4070, in fact, which had held the number one position since its release six months prior).

As for the RX 7700 XT, that was rather overshadowed by its bigger mid-range sibling here, not making as much sense value-wise as the 7800 XT.

Still, the long and short of it is that AMD bagged both the title of the best GPU for this year, as well as the best budget offering – not too shabby indeed.

From what we saw of sales reports – anecdotally and via the rumor mill – these new desktop graphics cards pepped up AMD’s sales a good deal. While the RX 7900 series GPUs were struggling against Nvidia early in 2023, towards the end of the year, the 7800 XT in particular was really shifting a lot of units (more than the RTX 4070).

While Nvidia is still the dominant desktop GPU power by far, it’s a sure bet AMD regained some turf with these popular RDNA 3 launches in 2023.

FSR 3 finally turns up

We did a fair bit of waiting for stuff from AMD this year as already observed, and another item to add to the list where patience was definitely required was FSR 3.

FSR is, of course, AMD’s rival to DLSS for boosting frame rates in games, and more specifically, FSR 3 was Team Red’s response to DLSS 3 that uses frame generation technology (inserting extra frames into the game to artificially boost the frame rate).

FSR 3 was actually announced in November 2022 – as we covered in our roundup of AMD’s highlights for last year – and we predicted back then that it wouldn’t turn up for ages.

Indeed, it didn’t, and we heard nothing about FSR 3, save for a small info drop for game developers in March, for most of 2023. Then finally, at the end of September, AMD officially released FSR 3.

However, it wasn’t a simple case of that’s that and AMD was level-pegging with Nvidia suddenly. For starters, Nvidia went ahead and pushed out DLSS 3.5 (featuring ray reconstruction), and frankly, AMD’s frame generation feature was quite some way behind Team Green’s in its initial incarnation. It was also not nearly as widely supported – and remains so – with adoption moving at a sluggish pace, and only four games available that make use of FSR 3 so far.

But at least it’s here, and AMD made another important move in December, as the year drew to a close, releasing an improved version of FSR 3. We saw with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – the third game to introduce support – that the new version of FSR (3.0.3) runs a good deal more slickly, at least according to some reports.

On top of this, AMD also made FSR 3 open source. That means more games should be supported soon enough (and modders can, and already have, started introducing FSR 3 to some titles, but unofficial support will never be quite the same as the developer implementing the tech).

Furthermore, in terms of better support for games, Team Red did make another move at the same time as FSR 3. We’re talking about AMD’s Fluid Motion Frame (AFMF) tech which as well as being part of FSR 3 is integrated separately at a driver level.

This allows for frame generation boosts to be applied to all games – via the driver, with no need for the game to be coded to support it – with the caveat being that it only works with RX 7000 and 6000 GPUs. Now that’s great, but note that what you’re getting here is a ‘lite’ version of the frame generation process applied in FSR.

As 2023 now comes to a close, AFMF is still in preview (testing) and somewhat wonky, though Team Red has improved the tech a fair bit since launch, much like FSR 3.

In short, it looks like AMD is getting there, and also ushering in innovations such as anti-lag+ (for reducing input latency, with RX 7000 and supported games only, although this has had its own issues). Not to mention the company is wrapping up all this tech in HYPR-RX, an easy-to-use one-click tuning mode that’ll apply relevant (supported) features to make a given game perform optimally (hopefully).

But there’s still that inevitable feeling of following in Nvidia’s wake when it comes to FSR and related features, with AMD rather struggling to keep up with the good ship Jensen.

Still, AMD appears to have an overarching vision it’s making solid, if somewhat slow, progress towards, but we certainly need to see more games that (officially) support FSR 3 – with an implementation impressive enough to equal DLSS 3 (or get close to it).

Portable goodness

This year saw some interesting launches from AMD on the portable device front, not the least of which was the Ryzen Z1 APU. Built on Zen 4, this mobile processor emerged in April to be the engine that several gaming handhelds were built around, notably the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.

There were two versions of the Z1, the 6-core vanilla chip, and a Z1 Extreme variant which was an 8-core CPU but crucially had a lot more graphics grunt (12 RDNA 3 CUs, rather than just 4 CUs for the baseline processor). The Z1 Extreme proved to be an immense boon to these Windows-powered gaming handhelds, driving the Legion Go to become what we called the true Steam Deck rival in our review.

The weakness of those Windows-toting Steam Deck rivals is, of course, the battery life trade-off (particularly when driving demanding games at more taxing settings). AMD was on hand to help here, too, introducing HYPR-RX Eco profiles to its graphics driver late in the year, which should offer a convenient way to tap into considerable power-savings (without too much performance trade-off – we hope).

Away from handhelds, in December we were also treated to the launch of a range of Ryzen 8000 CPUs for laptops. These ‘Hawk Point’ chips aren’t out yet, but will debut in notebooks in early 2024, although note that they’re Zen 4-based (the same as Ryzen 7000 silicon).

The line-up is led by the flagship Ryzen 9 8945HS, an 8-core processor with integrated graphics (Radeon 780M) that’ll be great for 1080p gaming (with some details toned down, mind). These chips will also benefit from AMD’s XDNA NPU (Neural Processing Unit) for accelerating AI tasks, and Team Red asserted that Hawk Point chips will be 1.4x faster than the Ryzen 7040 series in generative AI workloads – a pretty tasty upgrade.

AI bandwagon

Those Hawk Point mobile CPUs showed AMD’s growing focus on AI, and this was a broader push for Team Red throughout the year, which comes as no surprise – everyone who was anyone in tech, after all, was investing in artificial intelligence. Moreover, Nvidia made an absolute fortune in the AI space this year, and obviously that didn’t go unnoticed at AMD towers.

As well as incorporating heftier NPUs in its processors, in May AMD tapped Microsoft for resources and cash to help develop AI chips (for the gain of both companies). But the real power move for Team Red came late in the year, when in December AMD revealed a Zen 4 APU for AI applications (the largest chip it has ever made, in fact, bristling with 153 billion transistors).

The Instinct MI300A is loaded with 24 CPU cores plus a GPU with 228 CDNA 3 CUs and eight stacks of HBM3 memory, posing a genuine threat to Nvidia’s AI dominance. AMD’s testing indicates that the MI300A is about on par with Nvidia’s mighty H100 for AI performance, and as the year ended, we heard that firms like Microsoft and Meta are interested in adopting the tech.

AMD said that the Instinct MI300A will be priced competitively to poach customers from Nvidia, as you might expect, while acknowledging that Team Green will of course remain dominant in this space in the near future. However, Lisa Su intends for her firm to take a “nice piece” of a huge AI market going forward, and if the MI300A is anything to go by, we don’t doubt it.

Year of the gremlins

While AMD had plenty of success stories in 2023, as we’ve seen, there were also lots of things that went wrong. Little things, medium-sized things, and great hulking gremlins crawling around in the works and making life difficult – or even miserable – for the owners of some AMD products who got unlucky.

Indeed, AMD was dogged by lots of issues early in the year, most notably a serious misstep with the cooling (vapor chamber) for RX 7900 XTX graphics cards. Although the flaw only affected a small percentage of reference boards, it’s absolutely one of the biggest GPU blunders we can recall in recent years. (Nvidia’s melting cables with the RTX 4090 being another obvious one).

We also witnessed a worrying flaw with AMD’s Ryzen 7000 CPUs randomly burning out in certain overclocking scenarios. Ouch, in a word.

Other examples of AMD’s woes this year include a graphics driver update in March bricking Windows installations (admittedly in rare cases, but still, this is a nasty thing to happen off the back of a simple Adrenalin driver update), and other driver bugs besides (causing freezing or crashing). And we also saw AMD chips that had security flaws of one kind or another, some more worrying than others.

Not to mention RX 7000 graphics cards consuming far too much power when idling in some PC setups (multiple monitors, or high refresh rate screens – a problem not resolved until near the end of the year, in fact).

There were other hitches besides, but you get the idea – 2023 was a less than ideal time for AMD in terms of gaffes and failures of various natures.

Concluding thoughts

Clearly, AMD tried the patience of gamers in some respects this year. First of all with those glaring assorted blunders which doubtless proved a source of frustration for some owners of their products. And secondly, purely due to making gamers wait an excessively lengthy time for features like FSR 3 – which seemed to take an age to come through – and ditto for filling out the rest of the RDNA 3 range, as those graphics cards took quite some time to arrive.

However, the latter were very much worth the wait. The double whammy for GPUs was a real coup for AMD, releasing the top budget graphics card in the RX 7600, and our favorite GPU of them all, the reigning RX 7800 XT that sits atop our ranking of the top boards available right now.

There were plenty of other highlights, such as releasing the best gaming CPU ever made – in the form of the Ryzen 7 7800X3D – which was a pretty sharp move this year. We also received a top-notch mobile APU for handhelds in the Ryzen Z1 Extreme.

AMD’s GPU sales were appropriately stoked as 2023 rolled on, and FSR – plus other related game boosting tech – seems to be coming together finally, albeit in an overly slow but steady manner as mentioned. In the field of AI, Team Red is suitably ramping up its CPUs, and with the Instinct MI300A accelerator it’s providing a meaningful challenge to Nvidia’s dominance.

In short, despite some worrying wobbles, 2023 was a good year for AMD. The future looks pretty rosy, too, certainly with next-gen Zen 5 processors that look set to get the drop on Intel’s Arrow Lake silicon next year. And some even more tantalizing Zen 5 laptop chips (‘Strix Point’ – sitting above Hawk Point, and sporting XDNA 2 and RDNA 3.5) are inbound for 2024.

Next-gen Radeon GPUs are a little sketchier – RDNA 4 is coming next year, but the range may top out at mid-tier products, as AMD refocuses more on AI graphics cards (as expected in terms of going where the profits are). Those RDNA 4 cards could still pack a value punch, though, and looking at the current mid-range champ, the RX 7800 XT, we’d be shocked if they didn’t.","('technology', 'r&d participant', 'amd')

"This morning is an important one for AMD – perhaps the most important of the year. After almost a year and a half of build-up, and even longer for actual development, AMD is launching their next generation GPU/APU/AI accelerator family, the Instinct MI300 series. Based on AMD's new CDNA 3 architecture, and combining it with AMD's proven Zen 4 cores, AMD will be making a full-court press for the high-end GPU and accelerator market with their new product, aiming to lead in both big-metal HPC as well as the burgeoning market for generative AI training and inference.

Taking the stage for AMD's launch event will be AMD CEO Dr. LIsa Su, as well as a numerous AMD executives and ecosystem partners, to detail, at last, AMD's latest generation GPU architecture, and the many forms it will come in. With both the MI300X accelerator and MI300A APU, AMD is aiming to cover most of the accelerator market, whether clients just need a powerful GPU or a tightly-coupled GPU/CPU pairing.

The stakes for today's announcement are significant. The market for generative AI is all but hardware constrained at the moment, much to the benefit of (and profits for) AMD's rival NVIDIA. So AMD is hoping to capitalize on this moment to cut off a piece – perhaps a very big piece – of the market for generative AI accelerators. AMD has made breaking into the server space their highest priority over the last half-decade, and now, they believe, is their time to take a big piece of the server GPU market.

12:56PM EST - We're here in San Jose for AMD's final and most important launch event of the year: Advancing AI

12:57PM EST - Today AMD is making the eagerly anticipated launch of their next-generation MI300 series of accelerators

12:58PM EST - Including MI300A, their first chiplet-based server APU, and MI300X, their stab at the most powerful GPU/accelerator possible for the AI market

12:59PM EST - I'd say the event is being held in AMD's backyard, but since AMD sold their campus here in the bay area several years ago, this is more like NVIDIA's backyard. Which is fitting, given that AMD is looking to capture a piece of the highly profitable Generative AI market from NVIDIA

12:59PM EST - We're supposed to start at 10am local time here - so in another minute or so

12:59PM EST - And hey, here we go. Right on time

01:00PM EST - Starting with an opening trailer

01:00PM EST - (And joining me on this morning's live blog is the always-awesome Gavin Bonshor)

01:00PM EST - Advancing AI... together

01:01PM EST - And here's AMD's CEO, Dr. Lisa Su

01:01PM EST - Today ""is all about AI""

01:01PM EST - And Lisa is diving right in

01:02PM EST - It's only been just a bit over a year since ChatGPT was launched. And it's turned the computing industry on its head rather quickly

01:02PM EST - AMD views AI as the single most transformative technology in the last 50 years

01:02PM EST - And with a rather quick adoption rate, despite being at the very beginning of the AI era

01:02PM EST - Lisa's listing off some of the use cases for AI

01:03PM EST - And the key to it? Generative AI. Which requires significant investments in infrastructure

01:03PM EST - (Which NVIDIA has captured the lion's share of thus far)

01:03PM EST - In 2023 AMD projected the CAGR for the AI market would be $350B by 2027

01:04PM EST - Now they think it's going to be $400B+ by 2027

01:04PM EST - A greater than 70% compound annual growth rate

01:04PM EST - AMD's AI strategy is centered around 3 big strategic priorities

01:05PM EST - A broad hardware portfolio, an open and proven software ecosystem, and partnerships to co-innovate with

01:05PM EST - (AMD has historically struggled with software in particular)

01:05PM EST - Now to products, starting with the cloud

01:06PM EST - Generative AI requires tens of thousands of accelerators at the high-end

01:06PM EST - The more compute, the better the model, the faster the answers

01:06PM EST - Launching today: AMD Instinct MI300X accelerator

01:06PM EST - ""Highest performance accelerator in the world for generative AI""

01:07PM EST - CDNA 3 comes wiht a new compute engine, sparsity support, industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity, etc

01:07PM EST - 3.4x more perf for BF16, 6.8x INT8 perf, 1.6x memory bandwidth

01:07PM EST - 153B transistors for MI300X

01:08PM EST - A dozen 5nm/6nm chiplets

01:08PM EST - 4 I/O Dies in the base layer

01:08PM EST - 256MB AMD Infinity Cache, Infinity Fabric Support, etc

01:08PM EST - 8 XCD compute dies stacked on top

01:08PM EST - 304 CDNA 3 compute units

01:08PM EST - Wired to the IODs via TSVs

01:09PM EST - And 8 stacks of HBM3 attached to the IODs, for 192GB of memory, 5.3 TB/second of bandwidth

01:09PM EST - And immediately jumping to the H100 comparisons

01:10PM EST - AMD has the advantage in memory capacity and bandwidth due to having more HBM stacks. And they think that's going to help carry them to victory over H100

01:10PM EST - AMD finds they have the performance advantage in FlashAttention-2 and Llama 2 70B. At the kernel level in TFLOPS

01:11PM EST - And how does MI300X scale?

01:11PM EST - Comparing a single 8 accelerator server

01:12PM EST - Bloom 176B (throughput) and Llama 2 70B (latency) inference performance.

01:12PM EST - And now AMD's first guest of many, Microsoft

01:13PM EST - MS CTO, Kevin Scott

01:14PM EST - Lisa is asking Kevin for his thoughts on where the industry is on this AI journey

01:15PM EST - Microsoft and AMD have been building the foundation for several years here

01:16PM EST - And MS will be offering MI300X Azure instances

01:16PM EST - MI300X VMs are available in preview today

01:17PM EST - (So MS apparently already has a meaningful quanity of the accelerators)

01:17PM EST - And that's MS. Back to Lisa

01:17PM EST - Now talking about the Instinct platform

01:18PM EST - Which is based on an OCP (OAM) hardware design

01:18PM EST - (No fancy name for the platform, unlike HGX)

01:18PM EST - So here's a whole 8-way MI300X board

01:18PM EST - Can be dropped into almost any OCP-compliant design

01:19PM EST - Making it easy to install MI300X

01:19PM EST - And making a point that AMD supports all of the same I/O and networking capabilities of the competition (but with better GPUs and memory, of course)

01:20PM EST - Customers are trying to maximize not just space, but capital expedetures and operational expedetures as well

01:20PM EST - On the OpEx side, more memory means being able to run either more models or bigger models

01:21PM EST - Which saves on CapEx expenses by buying fewer hardware units overall

01:21PM EST - And now for the next partner, Oracle. Karan Batta, the SVP of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

01:22PM EST - Oracle is one of AMD's major cloud computing customers

01:23PM EST - Oracle will be supporting MI300X as part of their bare metal compute offerings

01:23PM EST - And MI300X in a generative AI service that is in the works

01:24PM EST - Now on stage: AMD President Victor Peng to talk about software progress

01:25PM EST - AMD's software stack is traditionally been their achilles heel, despite efforts to improve it. Peng's big project has been to finally get things in order

01:25PM EST - Including building a unified AI software stack

01:25PM EST - Today's focus is on ROCm, AMD's GPU software stack

01:26PM EST - AMD has firmly attached their horse to open source, which they consider a huge benefit

01:26PM EST - Improving ROCm support for Radeon GPUs continues

01:26PM EST - ROMc 6 shipping later this month

01:27PM EST - It's been optimized for generative AI, for MI300 and other hardware

01:27PM EST - ""ROCm 6 delivers a quantum leap in performance and capability""

01:28PM EST - Software perf optimization example with LLMs

01:28PM EST - 2.6x from optimized libraries, 1.4x from HIP Graph, etc

01:28PM EST - This, combined with hardware changes, is how AMD is delivering 8x more GenAI perf on MI300X versus MI250 (with ROCm 5)

01:29PM EST - Recapping recent acquisitions as well, such as the nod AI compiler

01:30PM EST - And on the ecosystem level, AMD has an increasing number of partners

01:30PM EST - Hugging Face arguably being the most important, with 62K+ models up and running on AMD hardware

01:31PM EST - AMD GPUs will be supported in the OpenAI Triton 3.0 release

01:32PM EST - Now for more guests: Databricks, Essential AI, and Lamini

01:33PM EST - The four of them are having a short chat about the AI world and their experience with AMD

01:34PM EST - Talking about the development of major tools such as vLLM

01:34PM EST - Cost is a huge driver

01:36PM EST - It was very easy to incluide ROCm in Databricks' stack

01:36PM EST - Meanwhile Essential AI is taking a full stack approach

01:37PM EST - The ease of use of AMD's software was ""very pleasant""

01:38PM EST - And finally, Lamini's CEO, who has a PhD in Generative AI

01:39PM EST - Customers get to fully own their models

01:39PM EST - Imbuing LLNs with real knowledge

01:39PM EST - Had an AMD cloud in production for over the past year on MI210s/MI250s

01:40PM EST - Lamini has reached software parity with CUDA

01:41PM EST - Many of the genAI tools available today are open source

01:41PM EST - Many of them can run on ROCm today

01:43PM EST - AMD's Instinct products are critical to supporting the future of business software

01:46PM EST - And that's the mini-roundtable

01:47PM EST - Summing up the last 6 months of work on software

01:47PM EST - ROCm 6 shipping soon

01:47PM EST - 62K models running today, and more coming soon

01:48PM EST - And that's a wrap for Victor Peng. Back to Lisa Su

01:49PM EST - And now for another guest spot: Meta

01:49PM EST - Ajit Mathews, Sr. Director of Engineering at Meta AI

01:50PM EST - Meta opened access to the Llama 2 model family in July

01:50PM EST - ""An open approach leads to better and safer technology in the long-run""

01:51PM EST - Meta has been working with EPYC CPUs since 2019. And recently deployed Genoa at scale

01:51PM EST - But that partnership is much broader than CPUs

01:52PM EST - Been using the Instinct since 2020

01:53PM EST - And Meta is quite excited about MI300

01:53PM EST - Expanding their partnership to include Instinct in Facebook's datacenters

01:53PM EST - MI300X is one of their fastest design-to-deploy projects

01:54PM EST - And Meta is pleased with the optimizations done for ROCm

01:55PM EST - (All of these guests are here for a reason: AMD wants to demonstate that their platform is ready. That customers are using it today and are having success with it)

"Consumer CPUs in the last generation or two have grown by leaps and bounds in their numbers of cores and levels of power consumption. AMD's versions of its Ryzen 7000 processors without the ""X""—like the $429 AMD Ryzen 9 7900 here—have tweaked clock and power settings to bring them under 100 watts (100W), and they include a serviceable cooler. That's perfect if you don't want to spend half as much on your system cooling as on your CPU.

In the interest of brevity, this review will skip repeating all the details we've already covered in our past Ryzen 7000 desktop chip reviews, such as the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X and the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X. Instead, we'll primarily compare the Ryzen 9 7900 with the Ryzen 9 7900X. The one without the ""X"" is generally the better deal if you're a particularly efficiency-minded high-end user. However, if raw multicore power is your aim, we recommend the Editors' Choice award-winning Intel Core i7-13700K. Either way, a Ryzen 7000 or a 13th Gen Intel chip will likely require the investment in an all-new platform; the tipping point between the 13700K and the 7900 is really all about efficiency, as we'll explain.

The Ryzen 9 7900: A 7900X on a Power Diet

With the advent of its ""Zen 4"" architecture, AMD slightly changed its clock-speed and power paradigm. Traditionally, processors have had a thermal limit, which you ideally don’t want the CPU to come anywhere close to. Now, however, processors are being designed to operate close to and even at their thermal limit far more frequently. Most of the Ryzen 7000 Series processors we’ve reviewed to date have hit their thermal limit while under heavy load, even with a 240mm water cooler, and after doing so they throttle back to prevent their temperatures from rising any further.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

This is something of a ""maximum performance at all costs"" approach, as the processor attempts to achieve as much performance as possible within its thermal limitations. This has come along with a greatly increased power draw, and it's the reason AMD's CPUs ending in ""X"" don't include coolers in the box. Chips pulling as much as 230W from the CPU socket are far too hot for an inexpensive stock cooler to handle. However, as these CPUs are meant primarily for the high-performance enthusiast crowd that mostly uses aftermarket coolers anyway, it's not a huge concern.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

If you don't want your desktop to double as a space heater, AMD released lower-power models of existing processors, denoted by the lack of an X at the end of the product name. These non-X variants are put on a strict electrical diet. The 7900X has a 170W thermal design power, or TDP, and a 230W maximum socket draw. The Ryzen 9 7900 consumes a third of that, using the same 65W TDP and 88W socket draw as the AMD Ryzen 7 7700. However, this might be more restrictive for the 7900, as it has four more cores to feed than the 7700. To adjust for this lower power consumption, the base clock rate is down to 3.7GHz, compared with the 7900X at 4.7GHz. The maximum boost frequency is also reduced, from 5.6GHz to 5.4GHz.

As with the previous Ryzen generation, the Ryzen 7000X and non-X CPUs are identical from a hardware standpoint. Both the 7900 and 7900X use a two-CCD chiplet design with an Infinity Fabric interconnect between them. Each CCD has eight cores, and two cores on each CCD are disabled. This results in a 12-core/24-thread CPU. Each core has 64K of L1 cache and 1MB of L2 cache attached, and 64MB of L3 cache is shared among all 12 cores.

The included cooler is AMD's Wraith Prism model. For a stock cooler, it's a rather capable unit. A copper contact slug and heat pipes provide better heat transfer than all aluminum designs. The fin stack is fairly large and dense, making the cooler rated for 105W TDP processors. For a touch of style, it also has programmable RGB lighting. As it's a downdraft cooler, instead of the more common tower coolers, it should also provide much better airflow and cooling over the RAM and VRMs of whatever motherboard on which it's used.

AMD Ryzen 9 7900: Our Test Setup

AMD's Ryzen 9 7900 was benchmarked on our updated AMD AM5 test station. In short, the test bed is an ASRock X670E Taichi motherboard with 32GB of DDR5 memory clocked at the CPU's maximum supported RAM frequency (DDR5-5200). CPU cooling is handled by a Cooler Master PL240 Flux all-in-one liquid cooler, while an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition provides discrete graphics power. All of it is mounted on a Praxis Wetbench open-frame PC case with a SilverStone DA850 power supply handling power duties.

Benchmarks specifically testing integrated graphics were run on the Ryzen 9 7900's integrated graphics or IGP. All other tests used the GeForce RTX 3080.

Testing the AMD Ryzen 9 7900: CPU Benchmarks

Checking system memory bandwidth, we see the Ryzen 9 7900 tied with the 7900X, as we would expect. With the 7900X having nearly thrice the TDP, we expected it to be able to sustain much higher clocks than the 7900. But the AIDA cache results showed the 7900 much closer than anticipated.

L1 and L2 cache rates were only 5% or less behind the 7900X chip. Things changed in the L3 bandwidth, as the Ryzen 9 7900's read rate fell to 10% behind the 7900X, while the L3 write was almost 30% slower, only a little faster than the Ryzen 7 7700 models.

The Ryzen 9 7900 unexpectedly tied with the 7900X in the Adobe Premiere benchmark. This is an important reminder that not all execution threads are similarly demanding. For example, AVX instructions tend to be markedly power-hungry and generate a lot of heat. It would appear the Ryzen 9 7900X, with its higher voltage and power draw, generated excessive heat in this task and lowered its clock speed accordingly. The 7900, running on a much lower power curve, but using the same cooler, has less heat debt to contend with and so was able to match the 7900X frequency in this benchmark.

All other benchmarks in this suite showed no surprises. The Ryzen 9 7900X, with its generous power allowance, could almost always maintain a higher clock frequency under heavy load. The 7900X was slightly ahead of the 7900 in Photoshop and the single-thread benches, and the lead often grew in multi-threaded tasks.

As we saw the Intel Core i7-13700K ahead of the Ryzen 9 7900X in the last review, it had an even bigger advantage here when the AMD chip was limited by power draw. The Core i5-13600K is now almost a dead tie with the 7900 in all aspects.

Testing the AMD Ryzen 9 7900: Discrete Graphics Benchmarks

Our gaming results are no different than we saw in the Ryzen 9 7900X review. The synthetic Time Spy bench is designed to test all CPU capabilities, not just those most commonly used in games, and showed more separation in the CPU models. Otherwise, any Ryzen 7000 chip not equipped with 3D V-Cache was practically indistinguishable from another when paired with a RTX 3080. Intel's Raptor Lake CPUs had small wins in a few titles. Games have certainly become more multi-threaded in the past 10 years, but not all benefit from high core counts.

Testing the AMD Ryzen 9 7900: Integrated Graphics Benchmarks

No, this isn't a repeat of the last benchmarks; the integrated GPU results simply reinforce the last results. And though it's past broken-record status, we'll say again the integrated graphics in Ryzen 7000 CPUs are for generic home and office use and nothing more. Apart from the 3D V-Cache-enabled models, every Ryzen 7000 CPU in these tests was in essence tied with each other.

Testing the AMD Ryzen 9 7900: Power and Heat

Now, the Ryzen 9 7900 finally gets to show its secret superpowers. Compared with the Ryzen 9 7900X, the Ryzen 9 7950X, the Core i5-13600K, and especially the Core i7-13700K gulping down electricity, the 7900 politely sipped. The Core i5-13600K had a marginal lead over the 7900 in gaming, and the two traded blows in our CPU tests. But the Core i5-13600K used considerably more power to do it (71W, or nearly 40% more in Cinebench). Likewise, compared with the 7900X, the 7900 was only a step or two behind in the CPU tests and perfectly tied in gaming, but the 7900X was also using much more power (101W, or 55% more in Cinebench). It was almost embarrassing for the Core i7-13700K, having performed 10% to 20% ahead of the 7900 in our tests, but needing twice the power to do it.

It wasn't surprising to see the 7900 operate much cooler compared with the non-X Ryzen chips. It was also not too surprising that it ran just as cool as the Ryzen 7 7700, since both have the same 65W TDP and 88W socket power draw. What was surprising is that the Ryzen 9 7900 operated four more cores than the Ryzen 7 7700 using the same power limit without any massive clock drops. With AMD and Intel seemingly racing to the power-draw pole position with their recent performance chips, this level of efficiency is not only welcome but also quite impressive.

Testing the AMD Ryzen 9 7900: Wraith Prism Cooler

Having just raved about the Ryzen 9 7900's efficiency, it's important to see if it was only the result of the big liquid cooler on the test bed. As a non-X CPU, the 7900 ships with AMD's Wraith Prism cooler, the same one that ships with the Ryzen 7 7700. The Prism is rated to 105W TDP, which should be more than suitable.

As we see, the Wraith doesn't quite keep up with the Cooler Master AIO we use on the test bed, but that's almost splitting hairs. The 3 degree C delta is insignificant, as the CPU maintains the same clock speed. The Cinebench runs under both coolers were within 1.5% of each other, well within the margin of error of the test. As the Ryzen 9 7900 under the Wraith was still 20 degrees C under its thermal maximum, overclocking is still wide open, whether you want to simply use an auto-overclocking utility or AMD Ryzen Master to set a custom power limit. A 7900 under a Wraith may even be able to catch a 7900X given how close they already are in performance.

Verdict: Efficiency, the Least Glamorous Metric

Raw speed and record-breaking performance excite us. We love to quote bench numbers and brag to our friends about how we were able to score more premium gear than them. Even the higher price tags don't bother us (sometimes) because that's what you have to pay for the best gear. But underneath it is the oft-ignored or forgotten reality of the day-to-day costs of running our hardware.

Power and utility costs in some places are increasing at scary rates. While a new computer probably won't break your electricity bill, the current crop of power-hungry chips certainly won't help it. Then again, if you're looking to make some kind of server or heavy number-crunching machine that's going to be powered on several hours a day, maybe even 24/7, electrical costs become a much bigger concern. That says nothing about the heat output of the machine, which certainly can have an effect on your air-conditioning use, which in turn adds more to your power bill. At 100W less than the 7900X in CPU-heavy tasks, that's an extra kWh on your power bill for every 10 hours of heavy use. That may be only 10 cents per day, but it's an extra $36.50 every year.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

On the flip side, the primary difference between the 7900 and 7900X is only software. As both the 7900 and 7900X currently have the same retail price, it seems the market has realized that. Will you see an appreciable difference between a 7900 with an increased power limit for slightly better top-end performance or a 7900X that's been reined in for better efficiency? Not much, apart from the included Wraith cooler and the time to tweak their power envelopes. And though that used to be far more difficult, requiring manual changes to clock multipliers, voltage control, offsets, and more, AMD has made the process much simpler with its latest generations.

If you're a home hobbyist looking for maximum value, getting a plain Ryzen 9 7900 gets you a cooler to go with it, which saves you a little money in building a new system, or perhaps in upgrading an old one. The Wraith will serve admirably for moderate workloads—and even some heavy ones.

(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)

Though the 7900X doesn't come with a cooler, it is higher-binned silicon. Those worried about maximizing performance, or who already have an effective AM5-compatible cooler, might go that route as a way to improve their odds of winning the silicon lottery and eking out that last 100MHz of clock speed.

AMD's Ryzen 9 7900 plays quite similarly to the 7900X against competing Intel chips. The Core i5-13600K is still an impressive chip and costs $100 less than the Ryzen 9 7900, but the much higher power draw and lack of an included cooler cuts into that savings. The Core i7-13700K is a much different comparison. Both it and the Ryzen 9 7900 hover at a similar price. The Intel chip will best the Ryzen 9 7900 by 10% to 20%, depending on workload, but it also consumes twice as much power. Even if you took the currently cheaper DDR4 platform route with the Intel chip, the money you saved might trickle away over time in higher utility bills if you run the system heavily throughout the day. With that, if you're chiefly concerned with efficiency, this might be the midrange desktop chip to get, but the Intel Core i7-13700K will perform better every day of the week.

"In January 2022, we launched Amazon EC2 Hpc6a instances for customers to efficiently run their compute-bound high performance computing (HPC) workloads on AWS with up to 65 percent better price performance over comparable x86-based compute-optimized instances.

As their jobs grow more complex, customers have asked for more cores with more compute performance and more memory and network performance to reduce the time to complete jobs. Additionally, as customers look to bring more of their HPC workloads to EC2, they have asked how we can make it easier to distribute processes to make the best use of memory and network bandwidth, to align with their workload requirements.

Today, we are announcing the general availability of Amazon EC2 Hpc7a instances, the next generation of instance types that are purpose-built for tightly coupled HPC workloads. Hpc7a instances powered by the 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors (Genoa) deliver up to 2.5 times better performance compared to Hpc6a instances. These instances offer 300 Gbps Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) bandwidth powered by the AWS Nitro System, for fast and low-latency internode communications.

Hpc7a instances feature Double Data Rate 5 (DDR5) memory, which provides 50 percent higher memory bandwidth compared to DDR4 memory to enable high-speed access to data in memory. These instances are ideal for compute-intensive, latency-sensitive workloads such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and numerical weather prediction (NWP).

If you are running on Hpc6a, you can use Hpc7a instances and take advantage of the 2 times higher core density, 2.1 times higher effective memory bandwidth, and 3 times higher network bandwidth to lower the time needed to complete jobs compared to Hpc6a instances.

Here’s a quick infographic that shows you how the Hpc7a instances and the 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor (Genoa) compare to the previous instances and processor:

Hpc7a instances feature sizes of up to 192 cores of the AMD EPYC processors CPUs with 768 GiB RAM. Here are the detailed specs:

These instances provide higher compute, memory, and network performance to run the most compute-intensive workloads, such as CFD, weather forecasting, molecular dynamics, and computational chemistry on AWS.

Similar to EC2 Hpc7g instances released a month earlier, we are offering smaller instance sizes that makes it easier for customers to pick a smaller number of CPU cores to activate while keeping all other resources constant based on their workload requirements. For HPC workloads, common scenarios include providing more memory bandwidth per core for CFD workloads, allocating fewer cores in license-bound scenarios, and supporting more memory per core. To learn more, see Instance sizes in the Amazon EC2 Hpc7 family – a different experience in the AWS HPC Blog.

As with Hpc6a instances, you can use the Hpc7a instance to run your largest and most complex HPC simulations on EC2 and optimize for cost and performance. You can also use the new Hpc7a instances with AWS Batch and AWS ParallelCluster to simplify workload submission and cluster creation. You can also use Amazon FSx for Lustre for submillisecond latencies and up to hundreds of gigabytes per second of throughput for storage.

To achieve the best performance for HPC workloads, these instances have Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) disabled, they’re available in a single Availability Zone, and they have limited external network and EBS bandwidth.

Now Available

Amazon EC2 Hpc7a instances are available today in three AWS Regions: US East (Ohio), EU (Ireland), and US GovCloud for purchase in On-Demand, Reserved Instances, and Savings Plans. For more information, see the Amazon EC2 pricing page.

To learn more, visit our Hpc7a instances page and get in touch with our HPC team, AWS re:Post for EC2, or through your usual AWS Support contacts.

"AMD gaming chief Frank Azor is trying to thread a needle. He seemingly wants to say that AMD did not actually make Starfield, quite possibly the year’s biggest PC game, exclusively support AMD’s FSR upscaling technology at the expense of competitors like Nvidia DLSS.

But he clearly can’t. Azor says he can’t say what the contract includes. Instead, he repeatedly lands on this: “If they want to do DLSS, they have AMD’s full support.” He says there’s nothing blocking Bethesda from adding it to the game.

Azor, a co-founder of Alienware, has had many open conversations with me over the years, and this is the only thing he’s been cagey about all afternoon. AMD specifically prepped for this exact question, he says, because the situation’s a little delicate. “We want to be very careful not to put this answer onto our partners,” says Azor.

“If they ask us for DLSS support, we always tell them yes.”

He admits that — in general — when AMD pays publishers to bundle their games with a new graphics card, AMD does expect them to prioritize AMD features in return. “Money absolutely exchanges hands,” he says. “When we do bundles, we ask them: ‘Are you willing to prioritize FSR?’”

But Azor says that — in general — it’s a request rather than a demand. “If they ask us for DLSS support, we always tell them yes.”

Starfield will be bundled with AMD’s just-announced 7800 XT and 7700 XT graphics cards.

Azor says there’s another reason why Bethesda might have wanted to prioritize FSR, too. “Bethesda’s decision to use FSR is console leverage,” he explains. Starfield is also likely this year’s biggest Xbox game, and FSR runs on the AMD chips inside the Xbox Series X and S as well as competing graphics. Meanwhile, each version of Nvidia DLSS is exclusive to specific recent generations of Nvidia GPU.

But is Starfield contractually AMD-exclusive? Perhaps just temporarily exclusive? Azor isn’t going to say.

“If and when Bethesda wants to put DLSS into the game, they have our full support,” he reiterates.

Bethesda didn’t reply to repeated questions about whether it’ll add DLSS to the game.

Today, AMD is revealing FSR 3, which can dramatically increase the perceived frame rate of a game by adding frame generation — which uses machine learning to imagine a new frame between existing ones, like a more sophisticated version of motion smoothing on TVs. It also includes “Native Anti-Aliasing,” an optional new mode that uses FSR techniques to anti-alias and sharpen game graphics instead of upscaling them from a lower resolution.","(technology, product manufacturer, amd)

Update 4/27/2023, 7:40 am PT: AMD has now issued a second statement clarifying that it has identified the root cause, which is in fact the SoC voltage we identified below in our coverage. AMD has issued new firmware to reduce SoC voltages to 1.3V. You can read the second statement here.

Update 4/25/2022, 10:41 am PT: AMD has responded to the numerous reports of chip failures with a short statement acknowledging that claims do exist and that the company is investigating. The statement confirms that AMD is working with its ODM partners (motherboard makers) to ensure safe voltage settings are applied to its Ryzen 7000X3D CPUs, but doesn't name the specific actions that it is taking:



""We are aware of a limited number of reports online claiming that excess voltage while overclocking may have damaged the motherboard socket and pin pads. We are actively investigating the situation and are working with our ODM partners to ensure voltages applied to Ryzen 7000X3D CPUs via motherboard BIOS settings are within product specifications. Anyone whose CPU may have been impacted by this issue should contact AMD customer support."" -- AMD Spokesperson to Tom's Hardware.



Notably, the statement does not acknowledge the multiple reports of failures with standard Ryzen 7000 processors. ASUS has also issued a statement, clarifying that it will issue firmwares that limit SoC voltage to 1.3V. We're following up for more detail with AMD and will update as needed. Our original coverage with deeper details about the issues follows:

Update #2 4/26/2023 4:00pm PT: Multiple motherboard vendors have now issued press releases pointing to new firmwares they will release in the coming days, with many citing SoC voltage as the adjusted parameter. You can read the vendor statements here.



Original Article 4/24/2022, 9:49 pm PT: Multiple reports of Ryzen processors burning out have burst onto the internet over the last few days. The damaged chips have not only bulged out and overheated to the point they have become desoldered, but they have also done significant damage to the motherboards they are installed in. We reached out to our industry contacts and learned some new information about the nature of the problem and the scope of AMD's planned fix. Our information comes from multiple sources that wish to remain anonymous, but the info from our sources aligns on all key technical details. As with all unofficial information, we should take the finer details with a grain of salt until AMD issues an official statement.



First, we're told this condition can occur with both standard Ryzen 7000 models and the new Ryzen 7000X3D chips, though the latter is far more sensitive to the condition, and the root cause could be different between the two types of chips. AMD will issue a fix soon, but the timeline is unknown. We're told that failures have occurred with all motherboard brands, including Biostar, ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, and ASRock.



According to our sources and seconded by an ASUS statement to Der8auer, the problem stems from SoC voltages being altered to unsafe higher levels. This can be imposed from either the pre-programmed voltages used to support EXPO memory overclocking profiles or when a user manually adjusts the SoC voltages (a common practice to eke out a bit more memory overclocking headroom).



Our sources also added further details about the nature of the chip failures — in some cases, excessive SoC voltages destroy the chips' thermal sensors and thermal protection mechanisms, completely disabling its only means of detecting and protecting itself from overheating. As a result, the chip continues to operate without knowing its temperature or tripping the thermal protections.



AMD's modern chips often run at their thermal limits to squeeze out every last drop of performance within their safe thermal range — it isn't uncommon for them to run at 95C during normal operation — so they will automatically continue to draw more power until it dials back to remain within a safe temperature. In this case, the lack of temperature sensors and protection mechanisms allows the chip to receive more power beyond the recommended safe limits. This excessive power draw leads to overheating that eventually causes physical damage to the chip, like the bowing we've seen on the outside of several chip packages, or the desoldering reported by Der8auer.

The chip continues to receive excessive current through the motherboard socket during this death spiral of sorts, thus leading to the visible damage we can see in the socket to the vCore pins and the bulging on the chip's LGA pads. However, less visible damage also extends to the CPU SoC, CPU_VDDCR_SOC, and CPU VDD MISC rails/pins — they just don't pull enough current to leave visible scorching like we see with the vCore pins.

We do know that 1.25V is the recommended safe SoC voltage limit, and we're told that 1.4V and beyond definitely increases the likelihood of the condition occurring. To be clear, running beyond 1.4V doesn't ensure that your chip will burn out, but your odds will increase. Conversely, 1.35V appears to be ""safe."" Proceed at your own risk, though. [EDIT: AMD has issued a statement, clarifying that it will issue firmwares that limit SoC voltage to 1.3V. As such, this appears to be the maximum safe limit.]



Our sources say that AMD is working on a fix that includes a voltage cap or lock in the firmware/SMU, which should prevent EXPO memory profiles and simple BIOS manipulations from exceeding an as-yet-undefined limit. We're also told that AMD can't completely prevent SoC voltage manipulations because the amount fed to the chip is dictated by the VRMs, leaving a means for crafty motherboard vendors to allow voltage changes despite AMD's lock (this would not be the first time motherboard vendors have circumvented limits to offer rare functionalities).



A few motherboard vendors, like ASUS and MSI, have already issued new BIOSes to correct some of the issues. However, we have confirmed that failures have also occurred on Biostar, ASRock, and Gigabyte boards, so all vendors are impacted to some degree.



As with all forms of overclocking, any damage from using an EXPO overclocking profile is not covered by your warranty, but given the situation, we don't think that AMD or the motherboard vendors would use the lack of warrantied EXPO support to invalidate warranties.

The advertised performance you get from an EXPO profile is also not guaranteed by the chipmaker. It's also noteworthy that AMD's purportedly planned SoC voltage cap could lead to lower stable memory overclocking frequencies. However, we don't think that will matter too much to most Ryzen 7000 owners, as the sweet spot DDR5-6000 should work just fine within the proposed limits. However, extreme overclockers and those pushing the very bleeding edge of performance could end up with lower overclocking limits. Time will tell.

For now, you could take a few common sense approaches to potentially protect your chip while we await an official statement from AMD — but proceed at your own risk.



This condition means that, even though the odds are small, an EXPO profile could lead to physical damage to your chip and motherboard. If you use an EXPO profile, you should check your SoC voltage in your BIOS or with a utility like HWiNFO. If it is at or exceeds 1.4V, you should disable the profile and run the memory at standard stock settings. If you have manually dialed in a 1.4V or higher SoC voltage, dial that back to a safer setting for now. [EDIT: AMD later confirmed that 1.3V is the maximum safe voltage.]

Now all that is missing is the official word from AMD on the matter. We're told the company is moving quickly to resolve the issue, so we expect a statement to arrive soon. We'll update as necessary.","(technology, product manufacturer, amd)
