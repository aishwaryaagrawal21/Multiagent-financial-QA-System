"Nvidia (NVDA), a giant in data centers and gaming, is supercharging investor interest in artificial intelligence. Is Nvidia stock a buy?

X

Semiconductor, AI News

On Dec. 6, AMD (AMD) released a new AI chip, offering new competition to Nvidia in the huge, fast-growing market.

In November, Nvidia delivered another quarterly earnings beat-and-raise report. It also unveiled the H200, its latest graphics processing unit for training AI models.

The AI chip leader has suffered recently from reports that the U.S. will move to crack down on redesigned Nvidia AI (artificial intelligence) chips, which were intended to get around export controls.

Companies like Nvidia, AMD and Microsoft (MSFT) tap the emerging market for generative AI. Generative AI can create content, including written articles, from simple phrases by analyzing vast amounts of data. It can also write programming code.

For those looking for the top large-cap stocks to buy now, here's a dive into NVDA.

Nvidia Stock Technical Analysis

The AI chip leader broke out past a 476.09 buy point from a double-bottom base in early November, reaching a record 505.48 on Nov. 20. However, the advance from the Oct. 31 low came on light volume, the IBD MarketSmith chart shows.

The stock stumbled after Nvidia's Nov. 21 earnings report, falling back below the buy point and 21-day line. But it has found recent support at the 50-day line.

If NVDA stock gets back above the entry, the buy zone would go to 499.89, according to IBD Leaderboard.

Nvidia stock tested the still-valid 476.09 buy point on Dec. 8, but closed below it.

The relative strength line for Nvidia stock is starting to show some lag after rallying for most of 2023. A rising RS line, the blue line in IBD charts, shows that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500.

After a painful 2022, NVDA stock has soared more than 223% year to date. It mostly held up better than growth stocks at large during recent market sell-offs.

Nvidia joined IBD Leaderboard after gapping up on earnings in February.

NVDA earns an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. In other words, Nvidia stock is in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of technical and fundamental metrics.

Investors generally should focus on stocks with Comp Ratings of 90 or even 95 and above. Nvidia stock often earns a spot on the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and Sector Leaders lists.

The IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that NVDA carries a Relative Strength Rating of 97. That means it has outperformed 97% of all other stocks over the past year.

The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) holds both Nvidia stock and AMD stock.

NVDA Backstory, Rivals

The fabless chipmaker pioneered graphics processing units, or GPUs, to make video games more realistic. It's expanding in AI chips, used in supercomputers, data centers and drug development.

Nvidia's GPUs act as accelerators for central processing units, or CPUs, made by other companies. It's working on ""supercomputers"" combining its own CPUs and GPUs.

In addition, Nvidia chips are used for Bitcoin mining and self-driving electric cars.

Nvidia has made a big push into metaverse applications.

Fabless chip stocks include Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).

Currently, the fabless group ranks No. 92 out of 197 industry groups. Fabless companies design the hardware while outsourcing the manufacturing to a third-party firm.

For the best returns, investors should focus on companies that are leading the market and their own industry group.

Is Nvidia Stock A Buy?

On a fundamental level, Nvidia is poised for explosive growth. Earnings should more than triple this fiscal year, driven by booming chip sales for data centers and artificial intelligence.

The fabless chipmaker is expanding in other growth areas, such as automated electric cars, cloud gaming and the metaverse as well.

But AI competition is intensifying. Macroeconomic uncertainties linger. Geopolitical risks are also rife, from the U.S.-China trade war to actual war in Ukraine and Israel.

NVDA stock has staged a massive comeback, more than tripling in 2023 so far. Nvidia came under pressure after its latest earnings report. Shares are now rebounding from a key level, with the AI chip stock flirting with the buy point again.

Bottom line: Nvidia stock is not a buy right now, but it could be soon. As a chip company with exposure to top growth markets, NVDA is always one to watch.

"Blue Tower Asset Management, an investment Management Company, released its third quarter, 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the quarter, the Blue Tower Global Value had a -2.19% return net of fees (-1.94% gross). The rates on US government treasuries rose sharply this quarter as the Federal Reserve pushed back their predictions for interest rate decreases. This drop in long-term bond prices triggered a selloff in equity markets. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.

Blue Tower Asset Management highlighted stocks like NVVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the third quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides computer graphics processors, chipsets, and related multimedia software. On December 19, 2023, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $496.04 per share. One-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was -0.68%, and its shares gained 208.39% of their value over the last 52 weeks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $1.225 trillion.

Blue Tower Asset Management made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""In addition to the use of larger datasets, the training speed of AI models has increased dramatically. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock almost tripled in the first 3 quarters of this year with a 197% gain, and a large reason for this is the huge role they have played in recent AI improvements. Nvidia’s single GPU AI training speed performance has increased by a dramatic 1000x in 10 years with only 2.5x coming from Moore’s Law3 driven increases in chip density. Besides better chip manufacturing, there were three other improvement factors at play: simplifications in number representation for the weights of the neural networks, more complex mathematical instructions for reducing the computational overhead involved in mathematical calculations, and increased neuron sparsity (in neural networks, some neurons are useless and can be pruned from the network without reducing performance significantly). In addition to these single GPU improvements, Nvidia also made improvements in data center scale architecture that allows groups of GPUs to work more efficiently together. It is noteworthy that the vast majority of the improvement came from hardware architectural and software data improvements, rather than transition density. These improvements were likely the low-hanging fruit of training speed improvements as researchers will eventually converge on an ideal architecture. The simplification of going from 32-bit to 8-bit floating point numbers for measuring weights is a one-time gain that can’t be repeated again. I expect the rate of improvement to slow down over the next ten years and eventually approach the levels of Moore’s Law improvements in chip efficiency. The historical trend for computer hardware is for it to eventually be commoditized, and I believe this will eventually occur for Nvidia’s GPUs as well.""

"Can they beat expectations again?

Nvidia is set to report quarterly earnings on Nov. 21 after the stock market closes at 3:20 CDT.

They are expected to report an earnings-per-share (EPS) of $3.39 on $16.11 billion in revenue.

The EPS figure is significantly higher this quarter compared to last quarter's expectation of $2.07 per share.

The revenue figure is significantly higher this quarter compared to last quarter's expectation of $11.09 billion.

Nvidia earnings preview

If you're reading this article, you probably already know that Nvidia (NVDA) has had a stellar 2023. The tech stock opened the year at $210.00, and reached its new all time high of $504.60 today, Nov. 20.

Nvidia has been the darling of the artificial intelligence craze, spiking almost $100 after their earnings announcement in May 2023. The stock has rallied almost $100 this month alone, and there are big expectations for the stock this earnings season. I was shocked to see just how much the EPS and revenue figures have increased compared to last quarter.

The current EPS expectation of $3.39 is over 50% higher than the previous quarter's expectation of $2.07 per share.

The current revenue expectation of $16.11 billion is also almost 50% higher than the previous quarter's expectation of $11.09 billion. Just staggering numbers from the chip maker, and it seems as though they'll need to exceed these numbers yet again and post a strong guidance for next year if they want to keep this stock price sky high.

The stock price's expected move through this week based on current implied volatility is +-$37.64, which is just over 7% of the current stock price. This is a pretty large expected move for such a high-priced stock. This weekly expected move makes up over 50% of the expected move through the January 2024 monthly cycle, so there is a lot of market movement expected from this earnings announcement alone.

Bullish on NVDA stock for earnings

It's no surprise to see NVDA going straight to the moon after the surge of AI demand, and the expectation is that earnings will be very impressive this quarter. If that rings true, and they announce strong expectations for things to continue into next year, we could see little bearish resistance and the stock move higher.

Bearish on NVDA stock for earnings

Interestingly enough, it seems there is a lot of fear for downside movement this earnings quarter. At the end of the day, a massive increase in EPS and revenue expectations puts pressure on the company to deliver and paint a positive light. If they miss at all, or exhibit weak guidance for future quarters, we could easily see ""profit taking"" and long positions closed, which could put downside pressure on the stock.

There is still some turbulence in the sales relationship with China, which NVDA is closely tied to. This adds a layer of complexity to things, but negative political press is usually not good for single name equities regardless of who they are or what they produce. If there is shakiness on the earnings call, we could see the stock move lower.

"In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. A deeper analysis suggests a bullish view for NVIDIA and a bearish view for AMD.

NVIDIA develops graphics processing units (GPUs) semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, creative design, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, AMD designs processors and related technologies for AI, data centers, gaming, and business-computing applications.

Shares of NVDA are up 240% year-to-date. Meanwhile, AMD stock has gained 93% year-to-date, including a 20% return over the last three months.

Despite NVIDIA’s much higher gains this year, it’s trading at a much lower valuation than AMD. We’ll look at their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is currently trading at a P/E of 46.4 versus its three-year average P/E of 29.9.

NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)

At a P/E of around 64.3, NVIDIA is trading at a relatively small premium to its industry (compared to AMD’s premium anyway). In fact, the stock hasn’t been this cheap in a year, and its long-term gains also suggest a bullish view might be appropriate despite the tremendous year-to-date gain.

On a P/E basis, NVIDIA hasn’t been this cheap since December 2022. In fact, NVIDIA was trading at a P/E of over 100 just days ago — before the last earnings report. Of course, significantly higher earnings send a company’s P/E much lower if its stock price doesn’t change dramatically.

In NVIDIA’s case, its earnings exploded so much higher year-over-year that its P/E was cut nearly in half after just a small pullback from around $500 a share on November 22 to $489 on November 24. For its third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.02 per share on $18.1 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of $3.37 per share on $16.2 billion in revenue.

Story continues

On a comparative basis, NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, while its adjusted earnings rose nearly sevenfold year-over-year and 49% quarter-over-quarter. The chipmaker’s GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings rose more than 13 times from a year ago to $3.71 per share, also demonstrating exploding growth.

Before that earnings report, NVIDIA shares had soared to a record high of around $505 with a P/E of about 120 in November. Normally, I wouldn’t suggest a bullish view of a stock that has risen so much, so fast.

However, once the market recognizes its lower valuation — and recovers from management’s warning about significantly lower sales to China and other countries due to export restrictions — NVIDIA shares will likely continue their tear. Despite that warning, the chipmaker still guided for almost 231% revenue growth to $20 billion in the fourth quarter, so it clearly isn’t all that worried.

Even if the stock doesn’t recover dramatically in the near term, NVIDIA’s long-term stock-price gains of 267% over the last three years, 1,184% over the last five, and 13,066% over the last 10 provide some level of safety over the long term. In fact, I would use any near-term pullbacks to add to the position.

What is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?

NVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $660.39, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies upside potential of 36.7%.

Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)

At a P/E of 1,120, Advanced Micro Devices has the opposite problem of NVIDIA. Its valuation has skyrocketed because it’s now barely profitable. However, the chipmaker certainly isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so it’s only a matter of time before it bounces back. For now, though, a bearish view seems appropriate, pending a better entry price or improved earnings numbers.

In the third quarter, AMD reported $299 million in GAAP net income, although that was an improvement from net income of $66 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company’s net income rose 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. AMD also reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the quarter, up from $5.6 billion a year ago.

Unfortunately, AMD continues to play catch-up to NVIDIA in the area of artificial intelligence, although management did reveal some progress on its last earnings call, announcing improvements in the company’s AI software capabilities through R&D and acquisitions. Management also expects the MI300 data center chip, which will support AI models, to be “the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.” In short, AMD will likely catch up to NVIDIA at some point, but we’re not there yet.

What is the Price Target for AMD Stock?

Advanced Micro Devices has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $126.79, the average AMD stock price target implies upside potential of 2.9%.

Conclusion: Bullish on NVDA, Bearish on AMD

The battle between NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices has been going on for years, with one company pulling out in front of the other and then the other catching up and trading places. Nonetheless, neither of these companies is going anywhere anytime soon.

However, AMD could be playing catch-up to NVIDIA on AI for some time, calling for a wait-and-see approach. Meanwhile, NVIDIA will likely rerate higher once the market digests management’s warning about the new export restrictions.

Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore reiterated his overweight rating on NVDA stock and hiked his price target to 630 from 500.

""These are remarkable results, particularly in the context that the company is looking at so much unmet demand,"" Moore said. ""The breadth of AI spending is clearly growing and appears to be durable. The company is executing across silicon, systems, software, and supply chain as the market is inflecting.""

"Investors in NVIDIA Corporation NVDA need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $10.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.

What is Implied Volatility?

Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.

What do the Analysts Think?

Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NVIDIA shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NVIDIA is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Semiconductor - General industry that ranks in the Top 16% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, 12 analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $3.69 per share to $4.48 in that period.

Given the way analysts feel about NVIDIA right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.

"White Brook Capital Partners, an investment management firm, released its third quarter 2023 investor letter, a copy of which can be downloaded here. White Brook Capital Partners maintains its outperformance against the S&P Midcap 400 year to date, boasting a 6.49% increase compared to the index's 4.28% gain. However, it falls short of the S&P 500's impressive gain of 12.85%. Take a moment to review the fund's top 5 holdings to gain insights into their primary investment choices for 2023.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, White Brook Capital mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and explained its insights for the company. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara, California-based multinational technology company with a $1.1 trillion market capitalization. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) delivered a 218.64% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 191.27%. The stock closed at $465.66 per share on December 05, 2023.

Here is what White Brook Capital has to say about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it’s relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.""

"NVIDIA Corporation NVDA formally launched a China-specific lower version of its most powerful gaming chip, which complies with the U.S. restrictions on the company’s export of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to that country.

The graphic chip maker unveiled RTX 4090D on Thursday, which is available for sale on its China website. The newly launched graphic processing unit (GPU) has a reduced AI inference performance than the RTX 4090 sold in other countries.

According to a Bloomberg report, the chip has approximately 10% fewer processing cores than the RTX 4090. NVIDIA has also undertaken measures to prevent end-users from modifying the China-specific chip into a regular RTX 4090.

NVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus

NVIDIA Caught in the US-China Tech War

Over the past year, President Joe Biden's administration has been imposing trade restrictions to restrict China from getting its hands on cutting-edge technologies that can strengthen its military. Last year, the U.S. government restricted NVIDIA from selling its A100, A100X and H100 integrated circuits to China and Russia. It also banned the company from exporting DGX or other systems using A100 or H100 integrated circuits.

In October 2023, the Biden administration imposed fresh restrictions on the sale of AI chips and manufacturing equipment to China. The newly expanded restrictions have blocked NVIDIA from selling two AI chips — A800 and H800 — specifically created for the Chinese market following last year’s export curb.

NVIDIA had cautioned that the restrictions may hurt its business in China. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company revealed that it may be forced to discontinue its business operations from countries on the U.S. government’s export restriction list. The rules are expected to impact NVDA’s ability to support its existing customers and complete the development of certain products in a timely manner.

Story continues

However, by launching the less powerful version of RTX 4090, which complies with all US restrictions, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company will be able to boost its sales in China. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

GenAI Investment Aids NVIDIA’s Growth

NVIDIA has witnessed a remarkable run, showcasing a staggering 243% year-to-date surge in its stock price. The company also achieved a massive milestone in May 2023 by joining the exclusive club of companies with a $1 trillion market capitalization.

NVIDIA’s robust stock price performance has been primarily driven by hopes that the company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative AI. The company dominates the market for AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.

However, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.

NVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA’s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.

The generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end market, NVDA expects its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $20 billion from $6.05 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Other Companies Banking on AI Investment

As organizations pivot toward digital transformation, AI investments are set to soar in the coming years, becoming pivotal to staying competitive in the digital landscape. The latest projection from the International Data Corporation forecasts a monumental surge, estimating global AI spending to surpass $300 billion by 2026, indicating a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27% from 2022 to 2026.

Tech behemoths like Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Intel Corporation INTC and UiPath Inc. PATH are seizing the immense potential of the AI sector.

Meta is amplifying its presence in the AI realm with the groundbreaking Large Language Model Meta AI, or ""Llama."" Collaborating with Microsoft, Meta introduced Llama 2, the next-gen iteration, and Code Llama, an AI model proficient in generating and discussing code using text prompts. This Zacks Rank #2 company is set to launch Meta AI in beta — a sophisticated conversational assistant slated for integration across WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, extending to their Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest 3.

Intel made a significant shift by launching AI chips for data centers and personal computers in 2023 — a strategic leap in more than four decades. This move targets a robust foothold in the expansive AI domain, spanning cloud, enterprise servers, network infrastructure and edge computing — an alignment with the ever-evolving market trends. The upcoming Intel Gaudi3 chips, slated for release in 2024, signify this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's focus on advancing AI accelerators, catering to the growing demand for generative AI models and deep learning applications.

UiPath is enhancing its platform with AI-centric services to foster top-line growth in 2024. These include augmentations to existing AutoPilot services and broader cross-platform connectivity options. This Zacks Rank #2 company's Clipboard AI, recognized as one of TIME's Best Inventions of 2023, streamlines operations by eliminating manual copy-pasting.

"After reaching an important support level, Nvidia (NVDA) could be a good stock pick from a technical perspective. NVDA surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.

The 20-day simple moving average is a popular investing tool. Traders like this SMA because it offers a look back at a stock's price over a shorter period and helps smooth out price fluctuations. The 20-day can also show more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.

Like other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.

Over the past four weeks, NVDA has gained 13.7%. The company is currently ranked a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), another strong indication the stock could move even higher.

The bullish case solidifies once investors consider NVDA's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 8 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.

With a winning combination of earnings estimate revisions and hitting a key technical level, investors should keep their eye on NVDA for more gains in the near future.

"Kickstarting your investment journey can be both exciting and scary at the same time, and if you're new to investing, you may not know where to even begin. However, one thing is for certain -- stocks set to beat the market over the next 12 months serve as the perfect foundation for any kind of investor.

Now, let's break down why adding this one exceptional stock, highlighted below, to your portfolio could be a recipe for success.

Why You Should Pay Attention to Nvidia (NVDA)

NVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence (AI) based solutions that now support high performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms.

On May 20, 2019, NVDA was added to the Zacks Focus List at $39.13 per share. Shares have increased 1042.04% to $446.88 since then.

15 analysts revised their earnings estimate higher in the last 60 days for fiscal 2024, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $2.95 to $10.74. NVDA also boasts an average earnings surprise of 9.8%.

Additionally, Nvidia's earnings are expected to grow 221.6% for the current fiscal year.

It can be very profitable to buy stocks with rising earnings estimates, as stock prices respond to revisions. By adding a Focus List stock like NVDA, there's a great chance you'll be getting into a company whose future earnings estimates will be raised, which can lead to price momentum.

"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.

In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.

However, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.

Nvidia (NVDA) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.

Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.

While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:

Earnings Growth

Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.

While the historical EPS growth rate for Nvidia is 31.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 224.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of -12.8%.

Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio

Asset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.

Story continues

Right now, Nvidia has an S/TA ratio of 0.74, which means that the company gets $0.74 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.66, it can be said that the company is more efficient.

In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Nvidia is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 102.2% this year versus the industry average of -6.6%.

Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions

Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Nvidia. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.2% over the past month.

Bottom Line

While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Nvidia a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.

You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

This combination indicates that Nvidia is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.

"This week is Thanksgiving week in the U.S., a week that is typically slow for the market. Many traders do what I will be doing; they take an extended break around the holiday to spend time with their families. That doesn’t mean, though, that the days around the Thursday holiday are completely without any interest, and perhaps the biggest event this week will come after the market close when Nvidia (NVDA) reports their calendar Q3 earnings.

One company’s earnings are not usually of much import beyond their own shareholders, but Nvidia is different. It is a maker of graphics processors and mobile technologies with such a hold on the market for advanced hardware that they have become the embodiment of the market’s excitement about AI. So far, they have borne that responsibility well, not just beating estimates for earnings each quarter, but smashing them, while raising their guidance consistently along the way.

That has, almost inevitably, led to skepticism in some quarters. When a company grows as rapidly as Nvidia has and just seems to get everything right, people understandably start to question how sustainable that is. If nothing else, the law of large numbers as it applies to stock analysis makes continued growth unlikely. It is far easier to grow $100 million of sales by 100% than it is to do the same from a starting point of $1 billion. Also, at some point, the reasoning goes, growth in demand for AI related products has to plateau. Or, even if it continues to grow, a strong competitor to Nvidia will emerge.

Neither of those things have happened yet, though, and Nvidia just keeps going from strength to strength. That has been reflected in the stock over the last year:

NVDA has gained around 300% in 52 weeks, which looks a bit frothy until you dig into the numbers. A chart like that inevitably has some people shouting about how it is all hype and that NVDA is a great big bubble, or whatever. When you look at the details, though, that gain looks fully justified. One can even make a strong argument that, actually, it is underdone, and that NVDA still represents value at these levels. If this were pure speculation, we would be waiting for reality to catch up with the price, but in this case, it is the other way around.

The consensus of analysts’ estimates for Nvidia’s EPS this last quarter is $3.37, which is a 481% gain over the $0.58 per share of profit reported in the same quarter last year. That 300% pop doesn’t look quite so outlandish now, right? In fact, as I said, that implies that NVDA’s market price has failed to keep pace with the increases in earnings, let alone factor in massively improved growth rates that have proven sustainable for the full year, and that it is has at least 50% upside from here, just to keep up with the company’s performance.

When Nvidia reports this afternoon, I have no doubt that the naysayers will make themselves heard, no matter what the numbers say. Based on recent history, they will probably beat expectations and raise guidance again, but that will only embolden the bears further. They will cry that any pop in the stock that follows that is just more hype, even though it would be a perfectly logical reaction to another great quarter. What I am looking for, though, as someone who owns NVDA and is looking to add more, is a relatively unimpressive EPS number, or a note of caution about the future in the earnings commentary, or the analysts’ call that will follow the release at 5 PM today.

They could beat expectations, but not by the spectacular amounts that have become the norm recently. They could also point out what everyone already knows, that the economic future is uncertain, and the stock will still get hit hard as the notion that it is way overbought is pushed. Should that happen, big institutional investors, who typically rely more on facts and data than bluster and bombast, will step in and buy.

On the other hand, if NVDA delivers another blowout quarter and shares optimism about what is to come, even in the face of uncertainty, then institutional investors likely won't step in and buy in that scenario. But either way, NVDA will be a buy tomorrow morning. I believe there is a chance that the first scenario plays out, so will wait until after earnings to make a move, but at some point before the holiday, I will be buying.

"In the past year, the NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) has received significant attention from investors, spurred on by the burgeoning AI market. The tech titan’s Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been met with great demand amongst AI developers, positioning NVIDIA as a potent force within the AI industry.

Notably, while the company demonstrates remarkable potential in AI, it is also reaping substantial profits in the sector. Yet despite impressive revenue growth in the last reported quarter, and fuelled by an upswing in AI GPU sales, NVIDIA continues to navigate complex macroeconomic challenges. Persistent export restrictions have been detrimental to sales with organizations in countries such as China.

With the current setting of regulations, NVIDIA anticipates a notable decline in sales in regions burdened by these export control measures in the current quarter. As the US tightens its grip on export controls, NVIDIA is diligently striving to develop China-specific chips, however, it must be noted the U.S. is poised to tighten those controls further in an attempt to prevent spikes in new technologies that would favor Beijing.

The delay in launching the Chinese-focused AI chips has led the NVDA stock to shrink by 2.6% over the past month. Although this recent dip may appear as an enticing investment opportunity, it is important to bear in mind that the stock could experience short-term upheaval. Looking at the broader perspective, it may be advisable to explore other potential chip stocks. Exploring key financial metrics can provide further insight into the current situation.

Analyzing NVIDIA Corporation’s Financial Performance and Prospects from 2021 to 2023

The trailing-12-month Net Income of NVDA in the given period shows an overall upward trend with some fluctuations.

Starting from January 2021, the Net Income was $4.33 billion.

A consistent growth was seen over the following months, reaching a peak at $9.75 billion in January 2022.

However, a significant downward fluctuation occurred after this point. By October 2022, the Net Income had fallen to $5.95 billion, marking a decrease of approximately 39% from its peak.

This downward trend continued into the early part of 2023 when it bottomed out at $4.37 billion in January 2023.

However, a reversal was observed by April 2023, when the Net Income began to increase again, reaching $4.79 billion.

There was a substantial leap in the NVDA’s Net Income in July 2023, where it hit $10.33 billion.

The most recent data from October 2023 indicates a surge in the Net Income of NVDA to a record high of $18.88 billion. In terms of growth rate calculated from the start to the end of the series, there is a considerable increase from $4.33 billion in January 2021 to $18.88 billion in October 2023. The growth rate in this case is approximately 336%. From the above, its important to note the emphasis on the volatility in performance, as reflected in the oscillating trend, alongside the impressive overall growth rate. Despite periods of downswing, the last value in the series suggests a strong upturn for the reported period.

The trailing-12-month revenue trend for NVDA has generally been on the rise over the span of the recorded data series. Here’s the summary:

Started at $16.68 billion in January 2021.

Showed steady growth through 2021 and into the first half of 2022, peaking at $29.74 billion by July 2022.

Experienced a short dip to $28.56 billion by October 30, 2022

There was another decrease bringing the Revenue down to $25.88 billion by April 2023.

In July 2023, there was a strong resurgence up to $32.68 billion

A significant jump was observed by October 2023, where the Revenue hit a high of $44.87 billion.

Though the data series showed some fluctuations, the overall trend direction is upwards. Measuring from the start value in January 2021 to the last value in October 2023, NVDA experienced significant growth in its Revenue. The growth rate within this period is approximately 169%.

The reported Gross Margin of NVDA has experienced a series of fluctuations over the last three years.

On January 31, 2021, the Gross Margin was at 62.3%.

By May 2, 2021, there was a minor increase to 62.4%.

A more notable increase occurred by August 1, 2021, as the Gross Margin rose to 63.8%.

The upward trend continued through October 31, 2021, with the Gross Margin reaching 64.4%, and by January 30, 2022, hitting a peak of 64.9%.

However, as of May 1, 2022, the Gross Margin started declining, falling to a low of 57.8% by October 30, 2022.

By January 29, 2023, the Gross Margin kept decreasing to 56.9% and further fell to its lowest point of 56.3% on April 30, 2023.

However, from July 30, 2023, there was a noticeable surge in the Gross Margin, with it rising sharply to 64.6%.

This spike increased further, as by October 29, 2023, the Gross Margin had soared to its highest documented value of 69.9%.

The calculated growth rate from the initial 62.3% in January 2021 to the final recorded value of 69.9% in October 2023 reveals an overall positive trend despite the alternating upswing and downswing. Overall, NVDA’s Gross Margin shows resilience with a substantial recovery in the latter part of the data series, signifying a potentially brighter future moving forward.

The Current Ratio of NVDA has shown significant fluctuations over the analyzed period from January 2021 to October 2023.

On January 31, 2021, the Current Ratio was 4.09.

It then peaked at 7.145 on October 31, 2021.

Post this peak, there was a downward trend until the Current Ratio reached its lowest point, 2.787, in July 2023.

"Semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) enjoys a central position in the current Artificial Intelligence (AI) boom by virtue of its Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Underscoring its market position, NVDA’s revenue of $13.51 billion for the fiscal second quarter topped the $11.22 billion analysts’ estimate, while its adjusted EPS of $2.70 beat the $2.09 estimate.

However, last month, the United States expanded its restriction on exporting sophisticated NVDA AI chips beyond China to other regions, including some Middle Eastern countries. On the other hand, the company stated that it does not have an “immediate material impact.”

Meanwhile, the semiconductor industry is undergoing a slump. The worldwide sales of semiconductors came in at $124.50 billion for the second quarter of 2023, registering a 17.3% decrease from the second quarter of 2022.

Given this backdrop, let’s look at the trends of NVDA’s key financial metrics to understand why it could be wise to wait for a better entry point in the stock.

Examining NVIDIA Corporation’s Financial Performance: An In-Depth Analysis of Multiple Metrics from 2020 to 2023

Based on the given data, there have been significant fluctuations and trends in NVDA’s Price/Sales ratio (P/S). Below is a summary of the P/S movements:

From October 2020 to January 2021, NVDA’s P/S declined from 22.50 to 20.40, demonstrating a downward trend.

Between January and May of 2021, the P/S saw a mild reduction, decreasing slightly from 20.40 to 20.32.

However, between May and August 2021, the P/S increased remarkably from 20.32 to 23.73, indicating an upward movement.

Between August and October 2021, there was a significant increase in the P/S, jumping to 32.89 in October 2021.

Post the high of October 2021, a notable decline in the P/S was observed. As of January 2022, the P/S fell drastically to 24.67, followed by a further decrease to 15.92 in May 2022.

Subsequently, it declined further to 12.64 by July 2022, then slightly increased to 13.27 in October 2022, showing a tendency for stagnation with a slight upward trend.

By January 2023, the P/S made a strong comeback and stood at 21.32, showing a significant increase for that period.

The upward trend continued until April 2023, when the P/S peaked at 37.17, subsequently dropping slightly to 35.40 in July 2023.

Overall, comparing the first value in October 2020 (22.50) with the latest recorded value in July 2023 (35.40), NVDA’s Price/Sales ratio has seen a growth rate of approximately 57.33%.

However, it’s important to note the high levels of volatility within the period. It would be beneficial to closely watch the company’s financials and market conditions to predict future P/S movements.

The gross margin of NVDA displayed a mixed trend, with overall increasing values until mid-2022, followed by a downturn and then an upward correction. Here are some notable points in more detail:

On October 25, 2020, the gross margin was 62.60%.

A slight decrease was seen by January 31, 2021, where the margin was 62.30%.

The gross margin hovered over 62%-63% until May 2, 2021.

Thereafter, the margin climbed, reaching 64.90% on January 30, 2022.

It peaked at 65.30% on May 1, 2022.

A sharp decline was noted toward July 31, 2022, falling to 60.40%.

This downward trend continued, hitting a low of 56.30% on April 30, 2023.

An abrupt rebound was seen in July 2023, where the gross margin grew to 64.60%.

Measuring from the first value in October 2020 to the last given data point in July 2023, there is a growth rate of 3.19%. Please note that there is a marked fluctuation in the latter part of the series, which saw a fall and a notable recovery in the gross margin, illustrating the volatile performance of NVDA in recent years.

The ROIC of NVDA has experienced both upward and downward fluctuations over the period from October 2020 to July 2023. Key highlights include:

Starting from October 25, 2020, the ROIC was 0.27.

There was a dip in January 2021 with a ROIC of 0.233.

The value rebounded in May 2021 to 0.245 and further increased to its peak at 0.281 by January 30, 2022.

However, the subsequent period saw a distinct decreasing trend, reaching as low as 0.152 in October 2022.

This downtrend reversed dramatically in the second half of 2023, with the ROIC surging to 0.303 as of July 30, 2023.

Considering the last data point of 0.303 in July 2023 and the first data point of 0.27 in October 2020, there has been a growth rate calculated as approximately 11%. While recent data suggests some volatility, the current trend indicates a sharp recovery from previous lows in the ROIC of NVDA.

The series of data represents the current ratio of NVDA from October 2020 till July 2023. Here is a summary of the trend and fluctuations:

In October 2020, the current ratio was at 3.92.

There was a noticeable increase during 2021, reaching a peak at 7.14 in October 2021.

By January 2022, it declined slightly to 6.65 but still remained relatively high compared to the start of the trend.

A significant drop was observed in the first half of 2022, with the current ratio plunging to 3.62 in July 2022. It further fell to 3.39 by October 2022.

The current ratio modestly recovered to 3.52 in January 2023, only to experience a slight dip in April 2023 at 3.43.

By July 2023, the current ratio stood at 2.79, marking the lowest point in the entire series.

Overall, despite a promising growing trend in 2021, NVDA’s current ratio has experienced a substantial decline from the start of 2022 and into 2023. Measuring the growth rate from the first value to the last, corresponding to October 2020’s value of 3.92 to July 2023’s value of 2.79, illustrates a decrease of approximately -28.83%.

This indicates that the company’s short-term liquidity has deteriorated over the evaluated period. It’ll be critical to observe whether this downward trend continues or reverses in subsequent quarters.

Analyzing the Rising Trend of NVIDIA Corporation’s Share Price in 2023

The data for NVDA shows a general increasing trend in the share price from March 2023 to September 2023. Here’s a breakdown of the trends:

Starting from $265.10 on March 24, 2023, the share price slightly increased to $269.28 by the end of March 2023.

The month of April 2023 saw minute fluctuations, with the price finally settling at $270.12 by April 28, showing a general decelerating growth rate.

However, May 2023 witnessed a clear acceleration in the growth rate, starting at $281.73 on May 5 and reaching a high of $342.22 by the end of the month.

This rapid growth rate continued into June 2023, with the price soaring to $395.27 on June 2 and gradually climbing to a peak of $428.75 on June 23. This represents significant accelerated growth.

In July 2023, despite a momentary dip to $413.50 at its start, the price resumed an upward trajectory, eventually reaching $461.01 by July 21

In summary, throughout the observed period, NVDA’s stock price generally increased, exhibiting stages of accelerated growth, particularly in May and June 2023. Despite periodic fluctuations and decelerations, the overall trend indicates positive growth. Here is a chart of NVDA’s price over the past 180 days.

On March 18 and 25, 2023, it ranked #67.

From April 1, 2023, to May 6, 2023, the rank progressively improved from #63 to #62.

After a slight improvement to rank #59 on May 13, the rank soared to #43 by June 3.

After lingering at rank #45 for a few weeks, there was another drastic improvement to #27 by September 2, maintaining this position up till the last recorded date, September 14, 2023.

The POWR Ratings for NVDA showed particularly noteworthy dimensions in terms of Sentiment, Quality, and Momentum. When reviewing the data from March 2023 to September 2023, these three dimensions consistently had high ratings. Let’s discuss these three dimensions in more detail:

Sentiment: The Sentiment rating remained consistently high throughout the period, starting from 94 in March 2023 and reaching its peak at 99 in September 2023. This persistent high rating demonstrates an overall positive perception of NVDA during this time.

Quality: This dimension also stayed strong in its ratings. It started at a solid 84 in March 2023, gradually increased, and eventually reached an impressive rating of 95 by September 2023. The consistent upward trend signifies that the quality associated with NVDA has been improving over this period.

Notably, it peaked at 95 in June 2023, dropped slightly to 90 in July 2023, and then rose again, landing at 82 in September 2023. Despite some fluctuation, the Momentum ratings remained relatively high, indicating a strength of momentum in NVDA’s activities.

"What can be said about Nvidia (NVDA) that has not already been said? With year-to-date stock gains of close to 240%, crushing the 17% rise in the S&P 500 index, the market has run out of superlatives.

Expanding that horizon by one year and three years, the graphics chip giant has skyrocketed 210% and 265%, respectively. For investors who are thinking of taking profits, doing so could prove premature. Despite the strong stock performance, the shares still somehow appear cheap, because as the stock has risen, the company continue to raise its profit forecast. There’s a chance it can do so again when it reports third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results after Wednesday's closing bell.

The graphics chip powerhouse has proven that the euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI is more than hype. Unveiled in 2022, Nvidia’s generative AI accelerators have already seized market share from competitors who are only in the development stage. Nvidia’s expected growth for its GPU datacenter accelerators has spiked amid generative AI models such as ChatGPT in which Microsoft (MSFT) has made a significant investment via its partnership with OpenAI.

In a note to clients after its Q2 results, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said the results are a ""historical moment for the broader tech sector,"" likening Nvidia’s guidance and commentary to that of a ""drop the mic"" moment. There is likely to be continued datacenter revenue acceleration for many quarters to come, underscoring the opportunity within AI is still at a nascent stage. But to continue to the stock's upward trend, the company on Wednesday must continue to tout its growth prospects for the next quarter and beyond.

For the three months that ended September, Wall Street expects the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company to earn $3.10 per share on revenue of $14.89 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings came to 58 cents per share on revenue of $5.93 billion. For the full year, ending in December, earnings of $10.02 per share would rise 200% year over year, while full-year revenue of $50.68 billion would rise 88% year over year.

The expected revenue and earnings growth for the quarter and full year has tech investors gushing over Nvidia. Nvidia’s second quarter numbers and Q3 guidance suggests there is a sort of relentless demand for AI, especially in the datacenter, where the company’s revenue surged three-fold on a year-over-year basis. In the second quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted EPS of $2.70, which breezed past analysts's expectations by a whopping 30%.

For some context, Nvidia not only blew away its own guidance of $2.07, the consensus estimate for this quarter a year ago was a modest $1.07 per share. Q2 revenue also crushed Street estimates by a staggering 22%, coming in at $13.51 billion while the Street was looking for $11.1 billion. Aside from growing demand for generative AI, the revenue growth was driven by large language models utilizing Nvidia’s GPUs.

""The October quarter guidance of $16 billion was well above $12.6 billion estimates and quickly rising whisper numbers on the Street and will be fuel in the engine to ignite a tech rally we see continuing into the rest of the year,” Ives wrote. As a result, analysts are projecting NVDA stock to go even higher. The stock has a consensus price target of $580; from current levels of $493, that assumes additional premiums of close to 20%.

With the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions and growing demand for generative AI, Nvidia continues to enjoy tailwinds. Combined with rising margins and quarterly free cash flow, it would be a mistake to part with the stock ahead of Wednesday’s results.

""Our focus on scalable business models has its roots in our economic framework. As potential output moderated in most emerging countries, it became clear to us affordability was not improving and that low penetration was necessary but not sufficient for value creation. We eliminated companies from the portfolio that were struggling to generate revenue significantly in excess of fixed costs, often replacing them with passport companies such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Airbnb that were economically tied to emerging markets. Over a period of time, we have been successful in redefining the emerging markets opportunity set around real per capita GDP increases, growth in the middle class, revenue velocity and demand fulfilment. Combined with changes in the market backdrop that have resulted in privileged competitive positions for companies with financial strength and access to capital, we find our opportunity set expanding anew to include companies that are both based in emerging markets and conducive to value creation.""

"This morning, financial news channels are all giving extensive coverage to the event held yesterday by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) to present their new MI300X microchip. The standard take is that it will take a lot of business away from Nvidia (NVDA), whose status as the lone supplier of chips suitable for developing AI platforms has been responsible for that stock posting gains of well over 200% this year. So, is the news good or bad for AMD, good or bad for NVDA, or some combination of those things?

Maybe it is just the arrogance of someone who has worked in and around financial markets for forty years or so, but I believe that if you want an answer as to how any news or development is going to impact a company, the best thing to do is to look at how its stock performs once the information becomes public. On that basis, AMD getting into the rapidly expanding market for AI capable chips isn’t necessarily bad news for NVDA. The development of the MI300X was first announced back in June. Since then, NVDA has continued to show gains.

The above chart shows the performance of NVDA (blue line) and AMD (green line) over the last six months. As you can see, the announcement that AMD was developing a chip to compete with Nvidia has not really held back NVDA, which has gained over 20% over the period, nor has it really helped AMD, which has been basically flat. One assumes that that is a result of skepticism from traders and investors about whether AMD’s offering would prove to be a real competitor to NVDA. Maybe, given the difficulty of developing and manufacturing these chips, there was even some doubt that AMD would actually be able to make something that was a serious competitor.

What we learned yesterday is that the development program has been a success, and that AMD believes that they have a decent product. That view was supported by the news that some big customers, such as Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) have said that they would be open to using the MI300X. So, can we expect AMD to make rapid gains from here at the expense of NVDA?

That would definitely be the case if this were a zero sum game, but it isn’t. The market for AI capable chips is expanding so rapidly that there was never going to be only one manufacturer for any length of time. During the event the AMD CEO, Lisa Su, forecast that that market would reach in excess of $400 billion by 2027. If she is correct, competition for Nvidia was not just inevitable, but is actually necessary if demand is to be met.

The market knows this, of course, and has factored it into the current pricing of NVDA. Even if we assume that Su’s forecast is off by $100 billion, that still leaves a market of $300 billion in four years, and Nvidia’s revenue for fiscal year 2023 was just under $27 billion. That means even if the MI300X is wildly successful and grabs half the market, Nvidia’s revenue will still grow by around $123 billion by 2027. Using a more conservative number than the AMD CEO, there appears to still be plenty of upside for NVDA, that is currently trading at a forward P/E of 41.6 based on analysts’ estimates for 2024, and 25.1 for 2025.

AMD’s forward P/Es, at 60.8 and 40.4 for those years look a bit less attractive, but if the new generation of chips is even moderately successful, their revenue, which is currently roughly equal to NVDA’s, is about to enter a period of rapid growth, so the forecasts on which those numbers are based will prove to be underestimates and that stock, too, will have a big upside.

As I write on Thursday morning, it seems that traders agree with the view that the most important thing about yesterday’s event was Su’s bullish estimate of the growth in the market for AI capable chips, growth which leaves room for both AMD and NVDA to post further gains. You might think that what looks like a successful launch of a competitor’s product would hurt NVDA, but both stocks are up in early trading. That tells investors who trust the market to get it right most of the time all they need to know.

"Claret Asset Management, an investment management firm, released its third quarter 2023 investor letter, a copy of which can be downloaded here. As indicated by the fund, following the second-best first half of the century, the market bulls faced challenges in the third quarter of 2023. The S&P 500 recorded a loss of 3.27% in the three months ending September 30th, 2023. Analysts attribute this downturn to the surge in interest rates stemming from the Federal Reserve's measures to control inflation. The Canadian market fared slightly better, experiencing a loss of only 2.7% during the quarter. Take a moment to review the fund's top 5 holdings to gain insights into their primary investment choices for 2023.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Claret Asset Management mentioned NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and explained its insights for the company. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara, California-based multinational technology company with a $1.1 trillion market capitalization. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) delivered a 218.64% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 191.27%. The stock closed at $465.66 per share on December 05, 2023.

Here is what Claret Asset Management has to say about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""We have mentioned in the last letter that the “magnificent seven”, including NVIDIA Corporation,dominated the performance of the S&P 500. We might have left you with the feeling that we are bearish because we don’t find the Magnificent 7 attractive. Let us make it clear: we are just not so pessimistic as to believe there are only 7 growth opportunities in the entire global equity market. In fact, we are optimists and think opportunity is abundant. Just not in everyone’s current 7 favorite stocks.""

"Thanks to the AI (Artificial Intelligence)-driven rally, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has rallied quite a lot. Nonetheless, Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities expects Nvidia stock to more than double over the next 12 months, implying it could go well beyond $1,000. Additionally, concerns over its valuation are easing, reflecting back-to-back strong quarterly beats and a solid outlook. Analysts, including Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna and Quinn Bolton of Needham, find NVDA’s current valuation reasonable, implying more upside potential.

On August 23, Mosesmann increased his estimates for Nvidia following the Q2 earnings and upbeat Q3 guidance. He said, “Nvidia’s epic print and guide two quarters in a row is simply unprecedented and just getting started.” He raised the price target to $1,100 (implying about 139% upside potential from current levels) from $800 and maintains a Buy rating.

Another analyst, Rolland, increased the price target on NVDA stock to $600 from $575, driven by solid demand and an improving supply chain. In a note to investors dated August 24, the analyst said that “the demand seems unbounded” in the near term. Moreover, Rolland considers NVDA’s valuation to be reasonable and raised his price target to $600 from $575. Meanwhile, Bolton sees Nvidia’s valuation attractive and finds the stock’s risk/reward profile “favorable.”

Although these analysts are upbeat about NVDA stock and see further upside, the company faces challenges ahead.

Key Challenges

While Nvidia is poised to capitalize on increased investment in generative AI, export restrictions to China (a key market for the company), emerging competition, and concerns over whether Nvidia could sustain the current growth rate pose challenges.

Bolton doesn’t believe the export limits will have a significant effect on NVDA in the near term, even though the ongoing U.S.-China chip war is still a cause for concern. Further, the analyst believes the reduction in sales from China would be “filled by other geographies.”

Further, on August 24, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari said that he expects competition to increase from large cloud service providers. However, the analyst expects NVDA to maintain its lead in the foreseeable future. With this backdrop, let’s check how much Nvidia stock could rise further.

How Much is Nvidia Expected to Rise?

Analysts’ average 12-month price target of $631.8 implies a further upside potential of 37.22% from current levels. Despite the concerns around growth and competition, analysts maintain a bullish outlook.

With 38 Buy and one Hold recommendations, Nvidia stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating on TipRanks.

Bottom Line

Analysts see NVDA’s valuation as reasonable. In addition, the solid AI-led demand will enable Nvidia to deliver strong growth, driving its stock price higher. Further, significant cash flow generation will help Nvidia enhance its shareholders’ returns through share buybacks.

"Nvidia (NVDA) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Over the past month, shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -0.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 3.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $4.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +401.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +20.8%.

The consensus earnings estimate of $12.17 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +264.4%. This estimate has changed +14.7% over the last 30 days.

Story continues

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.71 indicates a change of +61.9% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +20.6%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $20.1 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +232.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $58.92 billion and $90.22 billion estimates indicate +118.4% and +53.1% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Nvidia reported revenues of $18.12 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +205.5%. EPS of $4.02 for the same period compares with $0.58 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +11.9%. The EPS surprise was +19.64%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

While investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.

"Nvidia (NVDA) shares rocketed Thursday after the graphics-chip maker crushed Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter on record data-center sales. NVDA stock surged more than 20% in morning trades.

X

The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company late Wednesday said it earned an adjusted $1.09 a share on sales of $7.19 billion in the quarter ended April 30. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected Nvidia earnings of 92 cents a share on sales of $6.53 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Nvidia earnings dropped 20% while sales declined 13% amid continued weak gaming-chip sales.

For the current quarter, Nvidia forecast sales of $11 billion, up 64% year over year. That target obliterated Wall Street's consensus estimate of $7.2 billion for fiscal second-quarter revenue.

Chief Executive Jensen Huang said his company is ramping up production to meet the massive demand for artificial intelligence technology.

NVDA Stock Surges After Report

In morning trades on the stock market today, NVDA stock screamed 24.4% higher to 379.85. During the regular session Wednesday, NVDA stock dropped 0.5% to close at 305.38.

""The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions — accelerated computing and generative AI,"" Huang said in a news release. ""A trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.""

He added, ""Our entire data center family of products — H100, Grace CPU, Grace Hopper Superchip, NVLink, Quantum 400 InfiniBand and BlueField-3 DPU — is in production. We are significantly increasing our supply to meet surging demand for them.""

In the first quarter, Nvidia's data-center sales rose 14% year over year to $4.28 billion.

That growth reflected strong demand from large consumer internet companies and cloud service providers for its graphics processing units and related tech, Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said in a statement. Customers are using its chips for artificial intelligence applications, including generative AI, she said.

Gaming-Chip Sales Remain Soft

Meanwhile, Nvidia's gaming-chip business saw sales decline 38% year over year to $2.24 billion in the first quarter. The decrease was the result of weaker demand due to the macroeconomic slowdown and lower shipments to normalize channel inventory levels, Kress said.

Wall Street analysts gushed about Nvidia's beat-and-raise report.

""Nvidia delivered strong upside in terms of reported fiscal Q1 results, as well as fiscal Q2 guide,"" Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers said in a note to clients. He called Nvidia's report ""positive"" in all caps with an exclamation point.

""Nvidia absolutely blew away prior expectations with their guide,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson said in a note to clients. ""I can't remember a semiconductor/hardware company as big as Nvidia (multiple billions in sales) ever surprising with a guide this much higher vs. expectations in my 20 years covering technology stocks.""

Nvidia Chief Warns Of Trade War Fallout

Earlier Wednesday, the Financial Times posted an interview with Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang in which he warned about the negative impact of U.S. trade restrictions on China.

The U.S. tech industry is at risk of ""enormous damage"" from the escalating battle over chips between Washington and Beijing, Huang said. U.S. export controls introduced by the Biden administration are cutting off American companies from a huge market, he said.

Nvidia is barred from selling its most advanced chips to China. The U.S. government is worried that China will use advanced processors for military applications.

NVDA Stock Gets AI Boost

NVDA stock has risen 109% year to date through Wednesday's close over investor enthusiasm for its critical role in the burgeoning artificial intelligence field. On Tuesday, Nvidia announced AI technology partnerships with Microsoft (MSFT) and Dell Technologies (DELL).

And last week, Nvidia announced a collaboration with ServiceNow (NOW) to develop enterprise-grade capabilities in generative AI.

Nvidia ranks fourth out of 37 stocks in IBD's fabless semiconductor industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. NVDA stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99.

Also, NVDA stock is on the IBD Leaderboard and Tech Leaders lists.

"Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) have gained 0.4% over the past four weeks to close the last trading session at $457.62, but there could still be a solid upside left in the stock if short-term price targets of Wall Street analysts are any indication. Going by the price targets, the mean estimate of $628.03 indicates a potential upside of 37.2%.

The average comprises 34 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $460 to a high of $1,100, with a standard deviation of $114.49. While the lowest estimate indicates an increase of 0.5% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 140.4% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.

While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.

However, an impressive consensus price target is not the only factor that indicates a potential upside in NVDA. This view is strengthened by the agreement among analysts that the company will report better earnings than what they estimated earlier. Though a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't give any idea as to how much the stock could surge, it has proven effective in predicting an upside.

Here's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets

According to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.

While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?

Story continues

They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.

However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.

That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.

Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in NVDA

Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 3.2% over the past month, as two estimates have gone higher compared to no negative revision.

Moreover, NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means it is in the top 5% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>

Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much NVDA could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.

In the weak market, the fund underperformed during the quarter, by falling 6.3% compared to the Dow’s 2.6% fall, the S&P 500’s 3.7% decline, the NASDAQ's 4.1% decline, and the fund’s benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth’s 3.1% decline.

Ithaka US Growth Strategy made the following comment about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing and accelerated computing due to its prowess in the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including data center acceleration, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: first, the stock benefited from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI technologies and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products for years to come; second, Nvidia posted a another beat-and-raise quarter, besting Street estimates by 23% on the top-line and 33% on the bottom-line. We trimmed our NVIDIA position once during the quarter after it crested our self-imposed cap of 8% in any one holding and added the proceeds to two other portfolio holdings.""
