Why This 1 Growth Stock Should Be On Your Watchlist

Different than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company. Thus, they'll want to focus on the Growth Style Score, which analyzes characteristics like projected and historical earnings, sales, and cash flow to find stocks that will see sustainable growth over time.

Microsoft (MSFT)

MSFT boasts a Growth Style Score of A and VGM Score of B, and holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Its bottom-line is projected to rise 13.5% year-over-year for 2024, while Wall Street anticipates its top line to improve by 14.3%.

17 analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.23 to $11.13 per share for 2024. MSFT boasts an average earnings surprise of 7.8%.

Looking at cash flow, Microsoft is expected to report cash flow growth of 3.9% this year; MSFT has generated cash flow growth of 16.6% over the past three to five years.

With solid fundamentals, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Growth and VGM Style Scores, MSFT should be on investors' short lists.

"Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) have gone on an impressive run over the past couple of weeks, rising 12.6% in thirty days, including 5% gains over the past week alone to reach an all-time high of $371.95 on Tuesday. The Satya Nadella-led tech giant now has a market cap of $2.75 trillion.

With the stock up 54% year to date, compared with a 17% rise in the S&P 500 index, there’s no question that the market has fallen in love with Microsoft, particularly on the heels of the company’s Q1 2024 earnings results, which showed better-than-expected growth at its Azure cloud unit. Q1 revenues beat consensus expectations by a significant margin, coming in at $56.5 billion. Not only was that ahead of consensus by 4%, it translates to a 13% growth year over year.

The revenue beat was driven by strong demand in the personal computing segment, intelligent cloud segment and productivity and business processes segment, which beat Street estimates by 7%, 3% and 2% respectively. Just as impressive, during the quarter, Azure revenue grew almost 30% year over year. Notably, Azure revenue surpassed the high end of the company’s own guidance by two percentage points.

In terms of profits, Microsoft delivered $40.2 billion, thanks to 16% rise in gross profit, which beat consensus by 7%. Owing to the strength of Azure and Office 365, Q1 gross margin improved three percentage points sequentially, all of which contributed to a 25% year over year rise in operating income which reached $26.9 billion. Thanks to higher gross margins, operating income beat consensus by 12%, underscoring the efficiency-focused management team.

During the quarter, Microsoft also shared that AI Services contributed 3 points, and that's really where the fun begins. It's hard to ignore Microsoft’s early dominance in realm of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which has been the main driver of the stock so far in 2023. The generative AI market is currently growing at 42% and could hit $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. The bulk of the revenue growth from generative AI, estimated $247 billion by 2032, will come from demand for the infrastructure needed to train AI models.

What's more, estimates suggests that the AI-assisted digital ads business could reach $192 billion in annual revenue by 2032, while revenue from AI servers could hit $134 billion. Given these immense capabilities, as well as AI’s ability to learn and solve problems like humans by using (among other things) advanced form of computer processing, the money-making potential is immense. The fact that AI Services contributed just 3 points to Microsoft’s bottom line during Q1 shows just how nascent the AI market still remains.

Having already deployed its AI services to more regions compared to its competitors, Microsoft announced that its next-generation H100 Virtual Machines will soon be available. Microsoft’s AI advances became known with ChatGPT by way of its $10 billion investment in OpenAI, giving Microsoft 33% ownership of the company. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing technology in history, hitting 2 billion users after only six months. Estimates suggests it can reach 3.4 billion global users by the end of 2023.

Microsoft is aiming to accelerate the pace of adoption and is now extending its AI leadership by finding ways to attract AI startups and digital-first companies to Azure by developing OpenAI APIs. Estimates are calling for Microsoft ’s AI growth prospects to get a 33% boost over the next several quarters. Last week, while citing the company’s deployment of artificial intelligence, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill referred to Microsoft as one of the best buy cycles seen in a long time.

In other words, even as Microsoft stock is sitting at all-time highs, there is plenty of value to be realized with its AI-driven focus.

"In the constantly evolving tech industry, tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has found a way to stay relevant year after year. Microsoft is undoubtedly one of the best businesses in the world, and financial metrics prove this, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should buy its stock. Near an all-time high, Microsoft’s valuation just doesn’t make sense. Therefore, we are neutral on the stock.

The Numbers Point Toward an Amazing Business

There are several ways one could analyze Microsoft stock and justify buying it. MSFT bulls can talk about Microsoft’s AI and cloud computing growth potential, which is indeed very promising, as the company has a 49% stake in OpenAI (the owner of ChatGPT) and operates Microsoft Azure, a growing cloud computing platform. But investors can also simply point to the firm’s financial metrics to prove how good of a business it really is, and that’s what we’ll do.

Microsoft’s Competitive Advantage Can be Quantified

A great way of determining if a company has a competitive advantage is by looking at its gross profit margin because it represents the premium that consumers are willing to pay over the cost of a product or service. An expanding gross margin indicates that a sustainable competitive advantage is present. If an existing company has no edge, then new entrants would gradually take away market share, leading to decreasing gross margins as pricing wars ensue to remain competitive.

Microsoft’s gross margin has been trending higher since Fiscal 2016, rising from 64% in 2016 to 69.4% for the trailing 12 months. As a result, its rising gross margin indicates that a competitive advantage is present.

Microsoft’s Competitive Edge Allows the Company to Print Cash

Microsoft’s competitive advantage has allowed the firm to operate very efficiently over the past decade and rake in the cash. To measure its efficiency, we’ll take a look at MSFT’s cash return on invested capital (known as CROIC, calculated as free cash flow divided by invested capital).

Story continues

Essentially, this measures how much free cash flow the company generates for every dollar of capital it invests. For the last 12 months, MSFT had a CROIC of 21.9%, which is well above the IT sector average of 3.2%. So, for every $1 the company invested in the past year, it generated 21.9 cents of free cash flow. Its five-year average CROIC of 24.2% is impressive as well. For context, Microsoft generated a whopping $63.2 billion worth of free cash flow for the trailing 12 months.

This excess cash can be used to return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, as MSFT already does, although not in large amounts.

The Caveat: The Valuation is Unattractive

As mentioned above, Microsoft is a great business, but you can’t just buy a business at any price. Valuation matters. There are a few reasons why MSFT’s valuation isn’t attractive. First, its forward P/E ratio of 32.9x is high. It’s actually higher than its five-year average forward P/E of 29.2x, and that’s exactly the problem.

We’re now in a higher interest rate environment than usual, which means that investors should be expecting higher returns from stocks since they can get relatively high interest rates from risk-free government bonds. Therefore, it doesn’t quite make sense that MSFT has a higher valuation now, in a high-rate environment, than it did when interest rates were much lower.

Adding to this, MSFT’s five-year average earnings-per-share CAGR comes in at 35.4% and its three-year CAGR is 18.9%. Meanwhile, the firm’s EPS is now expected to grow by 14% and 15% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. So, lower growth is expected going forward, but the valuation is higher than usual? This just isn’t a great setup, in our opinion. And remember — these EPS forecasts factor in MSFT’s AI and cloud computing potential.

Is MSFT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, MSFT comes in as a Strong Buy based on 30 Buys and just one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average MSFT stock price target of $408.76 implies 10.6% downside potential.

If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell MSFT stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research, with an average return of 31.77% per rating and a 97% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.

The Takeaway

Microsoft is a top-notch tech business, and this can be proven by looking at some of its financials. However, its valuation is too high for our liking, and we think there are better opportunities elsewhere. To conclude, we’re not saying that Microsoft stock will crash, but we believe that, at current levels, investors shouldn’t expect the same kind of gains from MSFT stock that they have become accustomed to. As a result, we’re staying on the sidelines until the stock falls to a more reasonable level.

"Without question the market has developed a seemingly insatiable appetite for artificial intelligence (AI) technology and the companies that can lead this new frontier. Seen as the promising future, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems like humans by using (among other things) an advanced form of computer processing which includes machine learning and neural networks.

Given these immense capabilities, investor interest in AI stocks, namely Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA), have skyrocketed over the past few months as the race to control the technology forges ahead. The money-making potential is immense. The generative AI market is currently growing at 42% and could hit $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. The bulk of the revenue growth from generative AI, estimated $247 billion by 2032, will come from demand for the infrastructure needed to train AI models.

“The release of consumer-focused artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT and Google’s Bard is set to fuel a decade-long boom,” noted Bloomberg. What's more, estimates suggests that the AI-assisted digital ads business could reach $192 billion in annual revenue by 2032, while revenue from AI servers could hit $134 billion. But just like other market trendy buzzwords that have captivated the investor community, not every company that puts out an “AI press release,” staking a claim of their piece of the pie, will thrive.

But if judging solely by their growth forecasts and stocks prices, there are two clear leaders at the moment: Microsoft and Nvidia. Microsoft’s AI advances became known with ChatGPT by way if its $10 billion investment in Open AI, giving Microsoft 33% ownership of the company. Many analysts referred to Microsoft’s AI bet as an ""iPhone moment.” Since then, ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing technology in history, hitting 2 billion users after only six months. Estimates suggests it can reach 3.4 billion global users by the end of 2023.

Microsoft’s AI advances with its AI integration is being regarded as the best among the cloud giants - a group that includes Amazon (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG , GOOGL). Estimates are calling for Microsoft ’s AI growth prospects to get a 33% boost. The challenge for investors in terms of valuation of Microsoft stock, what’s does that AI growth prospect equate to? Currently trading near all-time highs of $342, MSFT stock has risen 43% year to date, besting the 14% rise in the S&P 500 index.

Microsoft stock is more than 20% overvalued, according to several valuation metrics, including P/E which puts its fair value closer to $265. And that’s even when factoring three years worth of growth. The biggest risk in my book would be to assume that any of these conventional valuation metrics matter today. Microsoft’s AI-driven growth could push the stock towards $550 in the next five years, yielding 60% return or 12% annually.

Nvidia, which has soared 198% this year, skyrocketed close to 30% after its blowout first quarter earnings results and better-than-expected Q2 guidance. The stock gained $184 billion in one day, vaulting the stock north of a trillion-dollar valuation. Nvidia’s Q2 guidance and its proclaimed leading position as an AI chip supplier got investors excited, guiding for Q2 revenue of $11 billion, crushing estimates for revenue of $8.5 billion.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has declared that generative AI represents an “iPhone moment.” Investors have since recognized the importance of Nvidia’s GPU data center accelerators which can potentially serve as the backbone for generative AI infrastructure. On the Q1 conference call with analysts, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress affirmed that belief that data centers will inevitably switch to Nvidia’s products incorporating AI. “Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing,” Kress said.

Meanwhile, CEO Huang, in a press release, issued the sort of outlook that suggests Nvidia’s leadership in Generative AI is all but assured. “A trillion dollars of installed global data infrastructure will transition…to accelerated computing as companies race to apply AI to every product, service, and business process,” wrote Huang. The demand for Nvidia’s GPUs based on its Hopper and Ampere architecture was noticeable in its just-announced results.

Nvidia continues to enjoy not only tons of AI tailwinds, but also the company’s fundamentals continues to improve evidenced by its margin improvement. As such, despite the stock reaching all-time high levels, the best play here is to stay invested and add on any dips. NVDA stock is poised to reach $500 by the end of the year.

All told, this new AI frontier is getting crowded. It remains to be seen which companies ascend and which ones falter. But while AI has tons of room for growth, Microsoft and Nvidia have planted their flags and staked their leadership in this new frontier.

White Brook Capital Partners maintains its outperformance against the S&P Midcap 400 year to date, boasting a 6.49% increase compared to the index’s 4.28% gain. However, it falls short of the S&P 500’s impressive gain of 12.85%. Take a moment to review the fund’s top 5 holdings to gain insights into their primary investment choices for 2023.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, White Brook Capital mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and explained its insights for the company. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Redmond, Washington-based multinational technology corporation with a $2.7 trillion market capitalization. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered a 55.33% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 51.97%. The stock closed at $372.52 per share on December 08, 2023.

Here is what White Brook Capital has to say about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it’s relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.”

"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$359 and falling to the lows of US$316. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Microsoft's current trading price of US$321 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Microsoft’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft

Is Microsoft Still Cheap?

The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 11% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $361.14, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. What's more, Microsoft’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.

Can we expect growth from Microsoft?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Microsoft's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 51%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MSFT’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?

Story continues

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MSFT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Microsoft.

"Today we're going to take a look at the well-established Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company's stock led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Microsoft’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.

Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft

What Is Microsoft Worth?

According to my valuation model, Microsoft seems to be fairly priced at around 0.08% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $377.14, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. In addition to this, Microsoft has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.

What does the future of Microsoft look like?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 49% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Microsoft. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? MSFT’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on MSFT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

As indicated by the fund, following the second-best first half of the century, the market bulls faced challenges in the third quarter of 2023. The S&P 500 recorded a loss of 3.27% in the three months ending September 30th, 2023.

The Canadian market fared slightly better, experiencing a loss of only 2.7% during the quarter. Take a moment to review the fund's top 5 holdings to gain insights into their primary investment choices for 2023.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Claret Asset Management mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and explained its insights for the company. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Redmond, Washington-based multinational technology corporation with a $2.7 trillion market capitalization.

""We have mentioned in the last letter that the “magnificent seven”, including Microsoft Corporation, dominated the performance of the S&P 500. We might have left you with the feeling that we are bearish because we don’t find the Magnificent 7 attractive. Let us make it clear: we are just not so pessimistic as to believe there are only 7 growth opportunities in the entire global equity market. In fact, we are optimists and think opportunity is abundant. Just not in everyone’s current 7 favorite stocks.”

"Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) has been at the forefront of the AI-driven tech surge this year, with shares soaring over 40% year-to-date. The optimism surrounding the potential of AI has also stimulated record-breaking growth for the Nasdaq 100 in the first half of the year.

The hype around the new era of technology shows no sign of abating. The latest Markets Live Pulse survey revealed that an impressive 77% of the 514 respondents plan to increase or maintain their tech stock exposure over the subsequent six months, potentially inflating market valuations further.

MSFT is well-positioned to exploit the accelerating AI trend as it innovates to create intelligent machines that complement human reasoning.

Earlier this year, MSFT introduced its Copilot service, integrating into its Microsoft 365 software suite, using generative AI that enables it to more efficiently compose emails, summarize documents, analyze spreadsheet data, etc., and unlock a new wave of productivity growth. Consequently, it announced a new artificial intelligence subscription service for Microsoft 365 this month.

Additionally, significant upgrades were made to Bing Chat, Microsoft’s AI-powered chatbot.

While Microsoft is lagging behind Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) in cloud infrastructure, CEO Satya Nadella believes his company is leading when it comes to new artificial intelligence workloads such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Despite its elevated valuation, a closer look at its robust financial metrics suggests a promising buying opportunity for investors seeking solid returns and long-term value.

"Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its “Alger Spectra Fund” third quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the third quarter, the fund underperformed the Russell 3000 Growth Index. The energy and consumer staples sectors were the contributors to the fund’s relative performance in the quarter, while communication services and health care detracted. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.

Alger Spectra Fund highlighted stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the third quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops, and licenses software, services, devices, and solutions. On November 3, 2023, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock closed at $352.80 per share. One-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was 6.97%, and its shares gained 54.83% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a market capitalization of $2.622 trillion.

Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America's transformative digitization. Microsoft's CEO expects technology spending as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to jump from about 5% now to 10% in 10 years and that Microsoft will continue to capture market share within the technology sector. The t company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the period, the company reported fiscal fourth quarter results that were slightly below expectations. This was largely because anticipations were high due to the company's robust year-to-date share price performance, which was buoyed by enthusiasm surrounding Al. Although quarterly revenues and earnings beat consensus estimates, management pointed out that they would be ramping up capital expenditures to support Al-driven operational growth. Notably, the company witnessed significant growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment as Azure continues to expand its market share. Despite the encouraging results, demand challenges stemming from companies looking to optimize their cloud spending led to a deceleration in cloud growth when compared to the previous quarter. Acknowledging that cloud optimization may curb the company's growth in the short term: we remain confident about the company's prospects going forward, particularly in the realm of Al adoption. Further, CEO Satya Nadella has recently indicated that substantial revenue contributions from Al will begin to materialize around the first half of 2024.""

"Microsoft (MSFT) is in talks to increase its investment in artificial intelligence startup OpenAI by $10 billion in a move to make its Bing search engine a stronger rival to Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, according to reports. MSFT stock edged up amid the reports while GOOGL stock also rose.

X

Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019. Microsoft's investment would be part of a new funding round for the AI startup.

OpenAI's technologies include ChatGPT, a chatbot that could make Microsoft Bing a stronger challenger to Google's internet search, and image-generation program Dall-E2.

The software giant also could integrate ChatGPT into its Bing internet search app. ChatGPT provides human-like answers to questions and generates documents.

MSFT Stock: Boost For Bing, Azure Cloud?

The Bing search engine holds nearly 9% of the market, while Google commands roughly 84%, according to Statista. Meanwhile, Google designed its search tools to provide links to websites and advertising.

Microsoft has integrated Dall-E2 tools into its graphics design software. Dall-E2 converts written text into pictures. Other OpenAI tools could be built into email platform Outlook and office productivity tools such as Word.

In a recent report, Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan said the OpenAI partnership could boost Microsoft's Azure cloud business.

""We expect dozens of new services from OpenAI/ChatGPT leveraging Azure's robust infrastructure in a virtual cycle,"" Horan said. ""These services will include true digital assistants, AI-based legal, accounting, financial services and dozens more. This consumer AI will then be used in enterprise (applications) in equally surprising ways.""

OpenAI has used Microsoft's Azure cloud computing unit to develop ""generative AI"" software tools that create new content from large public data sets. The startup uses machine learning techniques to train AI models. Further, the machine learning software gobbles up text, images, voice recordings, programming code and other forms of data.

A digestive process requiring powerful computer chips builds computer algorithms that pro-actively create new content. Most AI models are limited to making predictions based on pattern recognition. Internet search is just one application of generative AI. The technology also is finding applications in marketing/copywriting, drug and material development, video gaming and digital art.

GOOGL Stock: Big Artificial Intelligence R&D Budget

MSFT stock gained 0.8% to 228.85 on the stock market today. GOOGL stock edged up 0.5% to 88.42.

Meanwhile, Google's cloud computing unit has partnered with startup Cohere, a rival of OpenAI.

Also, Google owns DeepMind Technologies, a U.K.-based AI research laboratory. Google has developed generative AI tools called Language Model for Dialog Applications, known as LaMDA, which uses technology similar to OpenAI's.

According to a Bank of America report, Google has invested some $120 billion in artificial intelligence and cloud computing since 2016.

"Since reaching tis all-time high of $366 in mid July, shares of Microsoft (MSFT) have fallen as much as 15%. Currently trading at around $326, the stock is still up an impressive 36% year to date, besting the 10% rise in the S&P 500 index, even with a decline of close to 10% over the past three months.

The enterprise software and cloud giant is scheduled to report first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. Microsoft's stock outperformance, even amid the recent struggles in tech, continue to be driven by the company’s leadership position in AI, thanks to its multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. More recently, the company unveiled Microsoft 365 Copilot, an AI-powered version of its productivity platform.

As a result, the software and cloud giant have been a top pick among among investors and analysts. Microsoft made no secret that AI would be a key source of its future growth. In September, while speaking at Goldman Sach's Communacopia + Technology conference, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said that it ""absolutely should be the fastest $10 billion business we've ever built” when referencing Generative AI. Ahead of the tech giant's quarterly results Tuesday, Citigroup analysts agrees.

Citing stabilization in IT budgets and a ramp up in revenue related to generative artificial intelligence, the analysts expects Microsoft to deliver ""accelerating"" total revenue and profitability. Its Azure cloud platform and the availability of Microsoft 365 Copilot are also expected to see growth tailwinds. As for the latter, which is priced at $30 per month, some analysts believe it can boost Microsoft’s fiscal 2025 revenue by as much as $9 billion. On Tuesday, the company’s guidance will gauge how confident its management feels about that growth potential.

For the quarter that ended September, the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant is expected to earn $2.52 per share on revenue of $51.72 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $2.35 per share on $49.61 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending June, earnings are projected to rise 5.7% year over year to $10.37 per share, while full-year revenue of $222.33 billion would mark a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.

The company’s push into artificial intelligence by way of its $10 billion investment in Open AI is the “x-factor” in the market’s renewed optimism. AI is expected to fuel Microsoft’s market share among enterprise customers, not only for cloud adoption but also in its search capabilities. OpenAI recently updated its popular ChatGPT chatbot, bringing the ""Browse with Bing"" feature to all users. The app is now linked to the internet and offers browsing capabilities via Microsoft’s Bing for all users.

It remains to be seen how much traction Bing generates, compared to Google, but Bank of America analyst Brad Sills who has a Buy rating on the stock and $405 price target, loves Microsoft’s strategy. In a recent note to investors, Sills said he expects Microsoft to post ""modest"" upside, with catalysts coming later in the year. Citing recent checks, Sills said he sees ""sustained, healthy"" new workloads for Azure.

In the Q4, the company earned $2.69 per share, topping Wall Street estimates by 14 cents, while revenue of $56.2 billion rose 8.34% year over year, surpassing estimates by $700 million. Revenue was driven by 26% rise in Intelligent Cloud revenue to $24 billion, while revenue from Productivity and Business Processes, which includes Office commercial and consumer products and cloud services, rose 12% year over year to $18.3 billion.

Microsoft’s performance and execution makes the stock a must-own for any portfolio. Microsoft stock has the potential to reach $500 per share, if or when Copilot adoption reaches double-digit percentage growth annually, and AI development becomes a normal enterprise line item expense.

"Microsoft (MSFT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +14.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 14.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.75 per share, indicating a change of +18.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.7% over the last 30 days.

The consensus earnings estimate of $11.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13.5%. This estimate has changed +2.1% over the last 30 days.

Story continues

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.71 indicates a change of +14.2% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Microsoft.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $61.02 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $242.26 billion and $274.82 billion estimates indicate +14.3% and +13.4% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Microsoft reported revenues of $56.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.8%. EPS of $2.99 for the same period compares with $2.35 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $54.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.9%. The EPS surprise was +12.83%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Microsoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

"Both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 closed right at recent highs on Friday. The equally weighted S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 still have a way to go before nearing recent highs, however.

The mega-cap stocks like Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft have been the huge outperformers this year which accounts to the divergence between cap weighted QQQ and equal weighted QQQE.

Friday, though, finally showed some struggles for some of these mega-cap names even with the indices closing higher. Microsoft (MSFT), one of the mega-cap leaders, was actually down with both the S&P 500 and QQQ sharply higher.

Has the time arrived to begin to fade the rally in these red-hot names? Let’s take a look at Microsoft using the POWR Options process to see if the manic melt-up may be starting to stall in MSFT.

POWR Options likes to use a combination of fundamental and technical analysis along with looking at implied volatility to uncover trade ideas that have a probabilistic edge. This fusion approach helps put the odds in your favor. No guarantee (this is trading, after all) but an edge.

Let’s take a quick walk through the approach using Microsoft as an example.

Valuation

Microsoft stock is getting pricey once again on a valuation basis. Current Price/Sales (P/S) ratio now stands at the highest level this year and the highest since January 2022.

This even though the 10-year Treasury yield is still over 4% and the Fed Funds rate is at 5.25% to 5.5%. Back in January 2022 (the last time MSFT carried such lofty multiples) the Federal Reserve hadn’t even begun to raise rates off zero and the 10-year yield was at just over 1.5%.

To me, such historic increases in interest rates should dampen valuation multiples in a significant way. Plus, a 2.78 trillion dollar market cap company like Microsoft carrying a nearly 13x P/S ratio is difficult to justify since growth rates will necessarily be lessened simply due to the law of large numbers.

Technicals

MSFT stock is also showing some weakness (finally) from a technical perspective. Shares are struggling to break past the $380 area. 9-day RSI reached an extreme at 80 but has since fallen back to 56. Bollinger Percent B exceeded 100 and is now at 61. MACD also reached an extreme but just generated a sell signal by going negative. A break below the 20-day moving average could lead to further downside as it has done in the past.

Implied Volatility

Implied volatility (IV) is hovering at the lowest levels of the past year. This means option prices are cheap. A year ago, the 75-day at-the-money puts were trading at just over a 30 IV. Now the same 75-day at-the-money puts are trading at just a 23 IV.

To put the puts in perspective, the MSFT $255 puts were priced at $13.10 on 12/4/2022 with MSFT stock at $255.02. Now, similar $375 puts are priced at $14.40 with MSFT stock at $374.51. So, the 75-day puts are only $1.30 higher now even though Microsoft stock is $120 points higher! The percentage cost of put protection-and put prices-has dropped considerably to say the least. From over 5% a year ago to under 4% now.

This is the trade idea generation process we use on a daily basis for the POWR Options Portfolio. Combine fundamental, technical and implied volatility analysis in a fusion format.

Investors and traders alike may want to look to buy puts on an overvalued and overbought MSFT stock. The stock price hasn’t ever been this expensive and the put prices this cheap in a very long time.

Baron Opportunity Fund made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years, it has built an over $60 billion cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock detracted from performance because Microsoft is the Fund’s largest holding and shares retreated 7.1% after strong first half performance. For the June quarter, Microsoft reported better-than-expected Azure results for the third straight period, highlighted by Azure revenue growing 27% in constant currency. Its computing division also beat expectations, with Windows revenue benefiting from an early back-to-school inventory build. Microsoft’s September quarter revenue guidance came in below Street expectations; however, with Azure effectively in line and demonstrating stabilization, but computing seeing the negative sequential impact of the pull-forward in back-to-school purchases. Looking at the big picture, Microsoft continues to execute at a high level, navigating a challenging macro backdrop while aggressively investing in long-term growth, and we remain confident that Microsoft is well positioned to leverage AI over the medium to long term as it infuses Open AI and other generative AI technologies across its entire product portfolio.”

"Sam Altman, the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, a key figure in the artificial intelligence revolution, experienced a tumultuous series of events recently.

Initially dismissed by the company’s board on Friday, November 17, 2023, Altman’s departure was attributed to a board-conducted review, determining that he had not consistently communicated transparently, impeding the board’s ability to fulfill its responsibilities.

Consequently, the board stated it no longer had confidence in Altman’s leadership.

Following Altman’s ousting, OpenAI’s president and Altman ally, Greg Brockman, resigned, alongside three senior researchers. Subsequently, they, along with potentially hundreds of OpenAI employees, were reported to join Altman at Microsoft, which swiftly poached him to lead a new AI effort in the wake of a second leadership shakeup at OpenAI.

the mission continues https://t.co/d1pHiFxcSe — Sam Altman (@sama) November 20, 2023

However, the drama continued, as reported by the Verge on Monday, November 20, 2023. Altman and Brockman apparently expressed a willingness to return to OpenAI, provided the remaining board members who ousted Altman stepped down.

The mass departure of OpenAI staff, including influential figures like Ilya Sutskever, added substantial pressure on the board, with only two of the remaining three members needing to change their stance for a potential return.

Altman’s statement on X, “We are all going to work together some way or other,” suggests an ongoing struggle for resolution. Sources with direct knowledge of the situation revealed that Altman, Brockman, and the company’s investors are actively seeking a graceful exit for the board.

The Microsoft hiring announcement was characterized as a “holding pattern,” a temporary measure to address the crisis before the stock market opened on Monday, November 20, 2023. The situation remains fluid as stakeholders navigate a complex and evolving landscape.

"Will MSFT takeover of ATVI squelch competition? - Photo: Getty Images.

It’s a takeover which has been clouded by a myriad of challenges, from lawsuits to regulatory issues. Microsoft's (MSFT) $68.7bn (£56bn) takeover of gaming giant

Activision Blizzard (ATVI), is not only being hotly debated by global regulators but the ATVI stock price remains resolutely below the MSFT offer.

Back in January 2022, Microsoft announced plans to purchase Activision Blizzard for $69bn, or $95 a share. ATVI is currently trading at around $77 per share, as investors price in the risk that the takeover may never happen. Activision shareholders approved the deal in April 2022, with more than 98% of votes in favour.

With that said, unlike other tech stocks, the ATVI share price was up 15% last year. Microsoft's stock price plummeted 28% in 2022.

Microsoft (MSFT) share price chart

Gamers file lawsuit aganist MSFT takeover of ATVI

But ATVI's share price remaining below the MSFT offer is not the only issue that plagues this deal.

In December, Microsoft was hit with a further blow in a US court, when a private consumer lawsuit was filed claiming the technology giant’s purchase of the Call of Duty maker will unlawfully hinder competition in the video game market.

The complaint was filed in a California federal court with an administrative law judge, in the hope to stop Microsoft, which owns the Xbox console, from finalising one of the largest acquisitions in gaming history.

The complaint said: “This is a private antitrust action seeking an order of the Court prohibiting the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. by Microsoft Corporation as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. § 18). The threatened loss or damage to the Plaintiffs and to the public at-large by the merging of two giants in the video game industry is extensive and broad.”

“In addition to the elimination of a significant rival, the proposed acquisition may give Microsoft far-outsized market power in the video game industry and may enable

Microsoft to foreclose rivals to critical inputs and important markets.”

The plaintiffs named in the lawsuit are described as “individual citizens of the cities and states listed.”

“Each Plaintiff is a consumer of video games, all with the express interest and intent in ensuring that the industry remains competitive,” the lawsuit states.

“The potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft threatens loss and harm to the Plaintiffs, and to the public at large, of the salutary benefits of substantial

competition within the video game industry.”

But that's not the only concern. Global regulators are on a mission to also block the deal - it seems. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is seeking to block technology giant Microsoft from acquiring leading video game developer Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its blockbuster gaming franchises such as Call of Duty.

“The FTC alleges that the deal, Microsoft’s largest ever and the largest ever in the video gaming industry, would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox

gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business,” a FTC statement said.

The FTC highlights that MSFT has a history of acquiring and using valuable content in order to “suppress competition from rival consoles.”

This includes its acquisition of ZeniMax, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks (a well-known game developer).

“Microsoft decided to make several of Bethesda's titles including Starfield and Redfall Microsoft exclusives despite assurances it had given to European antitrust authorities that it had no incentive to withhold games from rival consoles,” the FTC statement added.

“Microsoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals,” said Holly Vedova, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition.

“We seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets.”

Sony (SNE) has, unsurprisingly, come out on the 'against' side, given its PlayStation console is in direct competition with Microsoft's X-Box. But Meta (META), owner of Facebook and Instagram said it has no problem with the deal.

Despite this rising tide of uncertainty, Microsoft (MSFT) Gaming CEO, Phil Spencer is upbeat about the takeover and in a Wall Street Journal Tech Live conference last year, Spencer said regulators investigating the deal have been ""fair and honest"" and he is confident the takeover will go through.

But not everyone is convinced that the deal will go as smoothly as MSFT hopes.

Activision Blizzard (ATVI) share price chart

Global regulators continue to interrogate MSFT and ATVI

Joshua Raymond, an investment expert wrote in a note: ""This deal was always at significant risk failure from Day One due to issues surrounding anti-competition and

the fact the US FTC has now moved to block the acquisition cements this view.”

“There has also been much evidence that the market was also expecting failure. Before the news emerged, Activision's share prices were still trading at a 20% discount on the $95 price offered by Microsoft. That tells you the market lacked belief the deal would get done.”

With that said, it's not just the FTC that Microsoft has to challenge, but European and UK regulators are scutinising this deal and there is risk it may fall apart.

On Friday, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) made the decision to extend the deadline of its inquiry into the deal until 26 April.

“In taking this decision, the Inquiry Group had regard to the scope and complexity of the investigation and the need to consider a large volume of evidence as well as main party and third party submissions,” Martin Coleman, Inquiry Group Chair said in a CMA statement.

EU antitrust regulators have also questioned the deal and quizzed game developers if they think that MSFT will block ATVI games once it has purchased the company.

But MSFT has had some good news.

Last month Chilean regulators approved the merger. It was announced last week that Chile’s fiscalia Nacional economica - The National economic Prosecutor’s office had cleared the deal following its phase one investigation.

MSFT takeover of ATVI is scheduled to complete this year, but a cloud hangs over the deal - which has caused a huge amount of controversy. From ATVI's low stock price, to global regulators and lawsuits damming the acquisition, MSFT still has a fight on its hands. With some of the biggest markets, such as the US, UK and Europe, all questioning whether the deal will squelch competition, it seems that MSFT’s ambitions to acquire ATVI hangs in the balance.",,"{""SECTOR"": [""Technology"", """"]}","{""title"": ""Microsoft and Activision Blizzard: ATVI stock price still below MSFT offer as regulatory hurdles persist"", ""publisher"": ""Capital.com"", ""authors"": NaN, ""published_date"": NaN}",

"Check out the companies making headlines before the bell.

Alphabet — The Google parent popped more than 6% after topping Wall Street's second-quarter earnings expectations, fueled by growth in its cloud-computing segment. The company also announced that its chief financial officer, Ruth Porat, would step into a new role as president and chief investment officer.

Microsoft — The software giant lost about 4% after reporting slowing revenue growth within its cloud business during its fiscal fourth quarter and called for lower-than-expected guidance. Microsoft, however, did beat Wall Street's estimates, reporting earnings of $2.69 per share on $56.19 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by Refinitiv anticipated earnings per share of $2.55 on revenue of $55.47 billion.

PacWest — Shares of the regional bank stock jumped more than 28% on news that it will be acquired by Banc of California to create a new firm called Pacific Western. Banc of California shares added about 6%.

Snap — The Snapchat parent shed more than 18% after issuing weak guidance for the current quarter. Snap topped second-quarter expectations, reporting a narrower-than-expected loss of 2 cent a share on $1.07 billion in revenue. That beat expectations for a 4-cent loss and revenues of $1.05 billion, per Refinitiv.

Coca-Cola - The beverage giant saw shares climb more than 2% in premarket trading after the company reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped estimates. Its organic revenue increased 11% in the quarter, fueled by higher prices. Coca-Cola also raised its full-year outlook following the strong report.

Boeing — The aircraft manufacturer rose more than 3% after it posted a revenue beat for the second quarter. Boeing's losses per share also came in lower than expected. The company's results were driven by an uptick in airplane deliveries.

Texas Instruments — Texas Instruments fell 4% even after reporting results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The semiconductor stock shared lighter-than-expected guidance for the current period, citing sluggish demand.

AT&T — AT&T rose 2% after posting its latest quarterly results.

Free cash flows topped expectation, which the company said it would use to pay down debt.

"Microsoft has exceeded EPS estimates four quarters in a row. Will it be five?

Microsoft will report quarterly earnings on October 24 after the stock market closes at 3:05 p.m. Central Time.

The tech giant is expected to post EPS of $2.65 on $54.54 billion in revenue.

Microsoft has exceeded EPS estimates four quarters in a row.

The Activision-Blizzard acquisition has finally closed, securing Microsoft's big gaming and VR investment.

Microsoft (MSFT) stock has had a great 2023 so far, opening the year at $243.08 and sitting well above that mark at a current price of $327.

The stock is already up 35% on the year, and we've yet to approach the holiday season where new bonus money tends to hit the stock market—we'll see if the recent market selloff will scare investors away or entice them to invest in big-name tech stocks like Microsoft.

The stock price has a +-$14.68 expected move through next week based on current implied volatility, which encompasses the upcoming earnings announcement. The stock has a +-$28.04 expected move through the December monthly options cycle, which means this earnings week accounts for about half of the expected movement through nearly the rest of the year.

Bullish on Microsoft Earnings

Microsoft finally closed its $69 billion gaming deal with Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) which is the biggest gaming deal we've seen yet. It also bolstered its artificial intelligence efforts, which sets the company up for a nice positive narrative on this quarterly earnings call.

Microsoft beat earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates four quarters in a row, and revenue estimates 75% of the time during the same period. I don't see much of a negative sentiment with Microsoft earnings this time around with so much positive news, but we'll see what the market says on Tuesday.

Bearish on Microsoft Earnings

Observers have lofty expectations of a strong forecast during Microsoft's earnings call this quarter, and this shouldn't surprise anyone after the massive acquisition of Activision-Blizzard. With grand expectations come an easier path to disappointment though. If future guidance is weak and the tech giant fails to beat EPS and/or revenue expectations—or any other negative surprise becomes known—we could see this popular tech stock fall in value after the earnings announcement in this bleak stock market we've seen recently.

Tune in on Tuesday, Oct. 24 at 11 a.m. Central Time for a full earnings strategy breakdown on Options Trading Concepts Live before the company's announcement.

"Jackson Peak Capital, an investment management firm, released its third quarter 2023 investor letter, a copy of which can be downloaded here. Established in March 2023, the firm observed its second full quarter of investment activity during Q3 2023. Despite challenging market conditions, Jackson Peak excelled in Q3, achieving a robust return of +11.8%. The quarter posed difficulties for the broader markets, but Jackson Peak's alternative long-short investment strategy proved successful, securing notable wins in each segment of the portfolio. Take a moment to review the fund's top 5 holdings to gain insights into their primary investment choices for 2023.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and explained its insights for the company. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Redmond, Washington-based technology corporation with a $2.7 trillion market capitalization. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered a 52.90% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 51.80%. The stock closed at $366.68 per share on November 13, 2023.

Here is what Jackson Peak Capital has to say about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""The Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)/Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) merger arbitrage came to a successful conclusion with the court denying the FTC’s preliminary injunction request. The deal subsequently received approval from the UK CMA and closed in October. The ATVI position was an example of “staying around the hoop” of a significant arb opportunity. At first, the position led to a small loss in Q2 when the UK CMA initially blocked the deal in April, but we stayed close to the case, analyzed the FTC trial and scaled up the ATVI position as it became apparent FTC had a weak case, meaning the probability of the deal going through was mispriced by the market since the companies would likely find a solution to work with the UK CMA (only global regulator who had an issue) if the FTC lost.""
