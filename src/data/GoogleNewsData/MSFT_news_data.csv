Different than value or momentum investors, growth-oriented investors are concerned with a stock's future prospects, and the overall financial health and strength of a company.

Assessing Microsoft (MSFT) Stock at All-Time Highs,"Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) have gone on an impressive run over the past couple of weeks, rising 12.6% in thirty days, including 5% gains over the past week alone to reach an all-time high of $371.95 on Tuesday. The Satya Nadella-led tech giant now has a market cap of $2.75 trillion.

With the stock up 54% year to date, compared with a 17% rise in the S&P 500 index, there’s no question that the market has fallen in love with Microsoft, particularly on the heels of the company’s Q1 2024 earnings results, which showed better-than-expected growth at its Azure cloud unit. Q1 revenues beat consensus expectations by a significant margin, coming in at $56.5 billion. Not only was that ahead of consensus by 4%, it translates to a 13% growth year over year.

The revenue beat was driven by strong demand in the personal computing segment, intelligent cloud segment and productivity and business processes segment, which beat Street estimates by 7%, 3% and 2% respectively. Just as impressive, during the quarter, Azure revenue grew almost 30% year over year. Notably, Azure revenue surpassed the high end of the company’s own guidance by two percentage points.

In terms of profits, Microsoft delivered $40.2 billion, thanks to 16% rise in gross profit, which beat consensus by 7%. Owing to the strength of Azure and Office 365, Q1 gross margin improved three percentage points sequentially, all of which contributed to a 25% year over year rise in operating income which reached $26.9 billion. Thanks to higher gross margins, operating income beat consensus by 12%, underscoring the efficiency-focused management team.

During the quarter, Microsoft also shared that AI Services contributed 3 points, and that's really where the fun begins. It's hard to ignore Microsoft’s early dominance in realm of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which has been the main driver of the stock so far in 2023. The generative AI market is currently growing at 42% and could hit $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. The bulk of the revenue growth from generative AI, estimated $247 billion by 2032, will come from demand for the infrastructure needed to train AI models.

What's more, estimates suggests that the AI-assisted digital ads business could reach $192 billion in annual revenue by 2032, while revenue from AI servers could hit $134 billion. Given these immense capabilities, as well as AI’s ability to learn and solve problems like humans by using (among other things) advanced form of computer processing, the money-making potential is immense. The fact that AI Services contributed just 3 points to Microsoft’s bottom line during Q1 shows just how nascent the AI market still remains.

Having already deployed its AI services to more regions compared to its competitors, Microsoft announced that its next-generation H100 Virtual Machines will soon be available. Microsoft’s AI advances became known with ChatGPT by way of its $10 billion investment in OpenAI, giving Microsoft 33% ownership of the company. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing technology in history, hitting 2 billion users after only six months. Estimates suggests it can reach 3.4 billion global users by the end of 2023.

Microsoft is aiming to accelerate the pace of adoption and is now extending its AI leadership by finding ways to attract AI startups and digital-first companies to Azure by developing OpenAI APIs. Estimates are calling for Microsoft ’s AI growth prospects to get a 33% boost over the next several quarters. Last week, while citing the company’s deployment of artificial intelligence, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill referred to Microsoft as one of the best buy cycles seen in a long time.

In other words, even as Microsoft stock is sitting at all-time highs, there is plenty of value to be realized with its AI-driven focus.

Prepared Remarks:

Operator

Greetings and welcome to the Microsoft fiscal year 2024 first quarter earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Brett Iversen, vice president of investor relations. Mr. Iversen, please go ahead.

Brett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer; Amy Hood, chief financial officer; Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer; and Keith Dolliver, corporate secretary and deputy general counsel. On the Microsoft investor relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today's call and provides a reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. More detailed outlook slides will be available on the Microsoft investor relations website when we provide outlook commentary on today's call.

Microsoft completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard on October 13, 2023. We will share more on the expected impact of the Activision acquisition during the outlook commentary portion of today's call. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

10 stocks we like better than Microsoft

When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* They just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Microsoft wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. See the 10 stocks *Stock Advisor returns as of October 23, 2023

They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we'll refer to the growth rate only.

We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft investor relations website.

During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factors section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Satya.

Satya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Brett. We are off to a strong start to the fiscal year driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $31.8 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24%. With Copilots, we are making the age of AI real for people and businesses everywhere. We are rapidly infusing AI across every layer of the tech stack and for every role of business process to drive productivity gains for our customers.

Now I'll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure. Azure, again, took share as organizations bring their workloads to our cloud. We have the most comprehensive cloud footprint with more than 60 data center regions worldwide, as well as the best AI infrastructure for both training and inference. And we also have our AI services deployed in more regions than any other cloud provider.

This quarter, we announced the general availability of our next-generation H100 virtual machines. Azure AI provides access to best-in-class frontier models from OpenAI and open-source models, including our own, as well as from Meta and Hugging Face, which customers can use to build their own AI apps while meeting cost, latency, and performance needs. Because of our overall differentiation, more than 18,000 organizations now use Azure OpenAI service, including new-to-Azure customers. And we are expanding our reach with digital-first companies with OpenAI APIs as leading AI start-ups use OpenAI to power their AI solutions, therefore, making them Azure customers as well.

We continue to see more cloud migrations with Azure Arc. We are meeting customers where they are, helping them run apps across on-prem, edge, and multicloud environments. We now have 21,000 Arc customers, up 140% year over year. We are the only other cloud provider to run Oracle's database services, making it simpler for customers to migrate their on-prem Oracle databases to our cloud.

Customers like PepsiCo and Vodafone will have access to a seamless, fully integrated experience for deploying, managing, and using Oracle database instances on Azure. And we are the cloud of choice for customers' SAP workloads to companies like Brother Industries, Hanes, Xis and ZF Group all run SAP on Azure. Now on to data. In the age of Copilots, organizations are looking to consolidate their data estate.

That's why with our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we are bringing together operational data stores, analytics, and governance. More than 73% of the Fortune 1000 use three or more of our data solutions today. And with Microsoft Fabric, we are unifying compute, storage, and governance into one end-to-end analytics solution with an all-inclusive business model. More than 16,000 customers are actively using Fabric, including over 50% of the Fortune 500.

Now on to developers. With GitHub Copilot, we are increasing developer productivity by up to 55% while helping them stay in the flow and bringing the joy back to coding. We have over 1 million paid Copilot users and more than 37,000 organizations that subscribe to Copilot for business, up 40% quarter over quarter, with significant traction outside the United States. This quarter, we added new capabilities with GitHub Copilot Chat, which are already being used by both digital natives like Shopify, as well as leading enterprises like Maersk and PwC to supercharge the productivity of their software developers.

All of the number of developers using GitHub has increased 4x since our acquisition five years ago. We have also brought Copilot to Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, build virtual agents, and analyze data. More than 126,000 organizations, including 3M, Equinor, Lumen Technologies, Nationwide, PG&E, and Toyota have all used Copilot and Power Platform to date. EUI, for example, has enabled Copilot for all 170,000-plus Power Platform users at the company.

And this quarter, we added new Copilot capabilities to Power Pages, making it possible to build data-driven websites using just a few sentences or clicks. Finally, Power Apps remains the market leader in low-code, no-code development now with 20 million monthly active users up 40% year over year. Now on to business applications. All our Dynamics 365 took share for the 10th consecutive quarter.

We're using this AI inflection point to redefine our role in business applications. We are becoming the Copilot-led business process transformation layer on top of existing CRM systems like Salesforce. For example, our sales Copilot helps sellers at more than 15,000 organizations, including Rockwell Automation, Sandvik Coromant, Securitas, and Teleperformance personalize customer interactions based on data from third-party CRMs. We're also bringing Copilot to Dynamics 365 to help with everything from suggested actions and content ideas to faster access to valuable business data.

And this quarter, we introduced Copilot and Dynamics 365 Field Service to help streamline frontline tasks. Now on to industry and cross-industry clouds. In healthcare, our Dragon Ambient eXperience solution helps clinicians automatically document patient interactions at the point of care. It's been used across more than 10 million interactions to date.

And with DAX Copilot, we are applying generative models to draft high-quality clinical notes in seconds, increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout. For example, Atrium Health, a leading provider in Southeast United States, credits DAX Copilot with helping its physicians each save up to 40 minutes per day in documentation time. We're also introducing healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, enabling providers like Northwestern Medicine and Sing Health to unify health data in a secure, compliant way. And with our Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty, which will become generally available by the end of the calendar year, we offer industry-leading data sovereignty and encryption controls, meeting the specific needs of public sector customers around the world.

Now on to future work. Copilot is your everyday AI assistant, helping you be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook and more collaborative in Teams. Tens of thousands of employees at customers like Bayer, KPMG, Mayo Clinic, Suncorp and Visa, including 40% of the Fortune 100, are using Copilot as part of our early access program. Customers tell us that once they use Copilot, they can't imagine work without it, and we are excited to make it generally available for enterprise customers next week.

This quarter, we also introduced a new hero experience in Copilot, helping employees tap into their entire universe of work, data, and knowledge using chat. And the new Copilot lab helps employees build their own work habits for this era of AI by helping them turn good prompts into great ones. When it comes to Teams, usage continues to grow with more than 320 million monthly active users, making Teams the place to work across chat, collaboration, meetings, and calling. This quarter, we introduced a new version of Teams that is up to two times faster while using 50% less memory and includes seamless cross-tenant communications and collaboration.

We have seen nine consecutive quarters of triple-digit revenue growth for Teams Rooms, and more than 10,000 paid customers now use Teams Premium. Teams has also become a multiplayer canvas for business process. There are more than 2,000 apps in Teams store and collaborative apps from Adobe, Atlassian, and Workday each exceeded 1 million monthly active users on Teams. And with Viva, we have created a new market category for employee experience, helping companies like Dell, Lloyds Banking Group, and PayPal build high-performance organizations.

With skills in Viva, we are bringing together information from Microsoft 365 and LinkedIn to help employers understand workforce gaps and suggest personalized learning content to address it, all in the flow of work. All up, we continue to see more organizations choose Microsoft 365 in companies across private and public sector, including Cerberus, Chanel, DXC Technology, all rely on our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now on to Windows. The PC market unit volumes were at roughly pre-pandemic levels.

And we continue to innovate across Windows, adding differentiated AI-powered experiences to the operating system. We rolled out the biggest update to Windows 11 ever with 150 new features, including new AI-powered experiences like Clipchamp, Paint and Photos. And we introduced Copilot in Windows, the Everyday AI companion, which incorporates the context of the web, your work data, and what you are doing on the PC to provide better assistance. We are seeing accelerated Windows 11 deployments worldwide from companies like BP, Eurowings, Kantar, and RBC.

Finally, with Windows 365 Boot and Switch, we are making it easier than ever for employees at companies like Crocs, Hamburg Commercial Bank, and the ING Bank to get a personalized Windows 365 Cloud PC with Copilot on any device. Now on to security. The speed, scale, and sophistication of cyberattacks today is unparalleled, and security is the No. 1 priority for CIOs worldwide.

We see high demand for Security Copilot, the industry's first and most advanced generative AI product, which is now seamlessly integrated with Microsoft 365 Defender. Dozens of organizations, including Bridgewater, Fidelity National Financial, and Government of Alberta, have been using Copilot in preview and early feedback has been positive. And we look forward to bringing Copilot to hundreds of organizations in the coming months as part of the new early access program so they can improve the productivity of their own security operation centers and stop threats at machine speed. More broadly, we continue to take share across all major categories we serve.

And our SIEM Microsoft Sentinel now has more than 25,000 customers and revenues past $1 billion annual run rate. And customers in every industry like Booz Allen Hamilton, Grant Thorton, and MetLife use our end-to-end solutions to protect their environment. Now on to LinkedIn. We are now applying this new generation of AI to transform how the 985 million members learn, sell, and get hired.

Membership growth has now accelerated each quarter for over two years in a row. This quarter, we introduced new AI-driven features across all of our businesses, including a learning coach that gives members personalized content guidelines and tools to help employers find qualified candidates and sellers and marketeers attract buyers in a single step. Since introducing AI-assisted messages for recruiters five months ago, three-fourths of them say it saves them time. And we have seen a nearly 80% increase in members watching AI-related learning courses this quarter.

More broadly, we continue to see record engagement and knowledge sharing on the platform. We now have more than 450 million newsletter subscriptions globally, up 3x year over year. Premium subscription sign-ups were up 55% year over year, and our hiring business took share for the fifth consecutive quarter. Now on to search advertising and news.

With our Copilots for the web, we are redefining how people use the Internet to search and create. Bing users have engaged in more than 1.9 billion chats, and Microsoft Edge has now gained share for 10 consecutive quarters. This quarter, we introduced new personalized answers, as well as support for DALL·E 3, helping people get more relevant answers and to create incredibly realistic images. More than 1.8 billion images have been created to date.

And with our Copilot in shopping, people can find more tailored recommendations and better deals. We're also expanding to new end points, bringing Bing to Meta's AI chat experience in order to provide more up-to-date answers, as well as access to real-time search information. Finally, we are integrating this new generation of AI directly into our ad platforms to more effectively connect marketeers to customer intent and chat experiences both from us, as well as customers like Axel Springer and Snap. Now on to gaming.

We were delighted to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King earlier this month. Together, we will advance our goal of bringing great games to players everywhere on any end point. Already with Game Pass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and discovered. We set a record for hours played per subscriber this quarter.

Prerelease stuff fill this quarter to broad acclaim. More than 11 million people have played the game to date. Nearly half of the hours played have been on PC and on launch day, we set a record for the most Game Pass subscriptions added on a single day ever. Minecraft has now surpassed 300 million copies sold and with Activision Blizzard King, we now add significant depth to our content portfolio.

We will have $13 billion-plus franchises from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And we're looking forward to one of our strongest first-party holiday lineup ever, including new titles like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Forza Motorsport. In closing, we are rapidly innovating to expand our opportunity across our consumer and commercial businesses as we help our customers thrive in this new era. In just a few weeks, we'll be holding our flagship Ignite Conference, where we will introduce more than 100 new products and capabilities, including exciting new AI innovations.

I encourage you to tune in. With that, I'll turn it over to Amy.

Amy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer

Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, revenue was $56.5 billion, up 13% and 12% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.99 and increased 27% and 26% in constant currency. Consistent execution by our sales teams and partners have a strong start to the fiscal year.

Results exceeded expectations, and we saw share gains again this quarter across many businesses as customers adopt our innovative solutions to transform their businesses. In our commercial business, the trends from the prior quarter continued. We saw healthy renewals, particularly in Microsoft 365 E5, and growth of new business continued to be moderated for stand-alone products sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. In Azure, as expected, the optimization trends were similar to Q4.

Higher-than-expected AI consumption contributed to revenue growth in Azure. In our consumer business, PC market unit volumes are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Advertising spend landed roughly in line with our expectations. And in gaming, strong engagement helped by the Starfield launch benefited Xbox content and services.

Commercial bookings increased 14% and 17% in constant currency, in line with expectations, primarily driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motion with continued growth in the number of $10 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 18% to $212 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 15% year over year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 20%.

And this quarter, our annuity mix was 96%. FX did not have a significant impact on our results and was roughly in line with our expectations on total company revenue, segment-level revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $31.8 billion and grew 24% and 23% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased slightly year over year to 73%, a point better than expected, primarily driven by improvement in Azure.

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by the improvement just mentioned in Azure, as well as Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Company gross margin dollars increased 16% and 15% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased year over year to 71%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points driven by the improvement in Azure and Office 365, as well as sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 1%, lower than expected due to cost efficiency focus, as well as investments that shifted to future quarters.

Operating expense growth was driven by marketing, LinkedIn, and cloud engineering, partially offset by devices. At a total company level, headcount at the end of September was 7% lower than a year ago. Operating income increased 25% and 24% in constant currency. Operating margins increased roughly 5 points year over year to 48%.

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins increased roughly 6 points driven by improved operating leverage through cost management and the higher gross margin noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $18.6 billion and grew 13% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected results in Office 365 commercial and LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 15% and 14% in constant currency.

Office 365 commercial revenue increased 18% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with a bit more in-period revenue recognition, while billings remained relatively in line with expectations. Growth continues to be driven by healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 10% year over year with installed base expansion across all customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier.

Office commercial licensing declined 17%, in line with the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Office consumer revenue increased 3% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 18% to $76.7 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 8%, ahead of expectations, driven by slightly better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Growth was driven by Talent Solutions, though we continue to see negative year-over-year bookings there from the weaker hiring environment in key verticals.

Dynamics revenue grew 22% and 21% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 28% and 26% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and gross margin percentage increased slightly year over year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point driven by improvement in Office 365. Operating expenses increased 2% and operating income increased 20% and 19% in constant currency.

Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $24.3 billion, increasing 19% and ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue grew 21%. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 29% and 28% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points from AI services.

While the trends from prior quarter continued, growth was ahead of expectations primarily driven by increased GPU capacity and better-than-expected GPU utilization of our AI services, as well as slightly higher-than-expected growth in our per-user business. In our per-user business, the Enterprise Mobility and Security install base grew 11% to over 259 million seats with continued impact from the growth trends in new stand-alone business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 2%, ahead of expectations, driven primarily by demand in advance of Windows Server 2012 end of support. Enterprise and partner services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected performance in enterprise support services.

Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by the improvement in Azure noted earlier, even as we scale our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. Operating expenses increased 2% and 1% in constant currency. Operating income grew 31% and 30% in constant currency.

Now to more personal computing. Revenue was $13.7 billion, increasing 3% and 2% in constant currency, above expectations with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue increased 4% year over year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected consumer channel inventory builds and the stabilizing PC market demand noted earlier, particularly in commercial. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 8%, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5.

Devices revenue decreased 22%, ahead of expectations due to stronger execution in the commercial segment. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 10% and 9% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. We saw increased engagement on Bing and Edge share gains again this quarter, although search revenue growth continues to be impacted by a third-party partnership. And in gaming.

Revenue increased 9% and 8% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected subscriber growth in Xbox Game Pass, as well as first-party content, primarily due to the Starfield launch. Xbox content and services revenue increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and Xbox hardware revenue declined 7% and 8% in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly 5 points year over year, driven primarily by sales mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Operating expenses declined 1%, and operating income increased 23% and 22% in constant currency.

Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $11.2 billion to support cloud demand, including investments to scale our AI infrastructure. Cash paid for PP&E was $9.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $30.6 billion, up 32% year over year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections.

Free cash flow was $20.7 billion, up 22% year over year. This quarter, other income and expense was $389 million, higher than anticipated, driven by interest income, partially offset by net losses on investments and foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

Now moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S. dollar basis. The Activision acquisition closed on October 13. So, my commentary includes the net impact of the deal from the date of acquisition.

Our outlook includes purchase accounting impact, integration and transaction-related expenses based on our current understanding of the purchase price allocation and related deal accounting. The net impact includes adjusting for the movement of Activision content from our prior relationship as a third-party partner to first party. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and segment-level revenue growth by approximately 1 point.

We expect FX to have no impact to COGS and operating expense growth. In commercial bookings, we expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motion, including healthy renewals, but growth will be impacted by a low-growth expiry base. Therefore, we expect bookings growth to be relatively flat. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be relatively flat year over year.

Excluding the impact from the accounting estimate change, Q2 cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly 1 point, primarily driven by improvement in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, driven by investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure. As a reminder, there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance.

In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11% and 12% or USD 18.8 billion to USD 19.1 billion. Growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower. In Office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth through E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be up roughly 16% in constant currency.

We're excited for Microsoft 365 Copilot general availability on November 1 and expect the related revenue to grow gradually over time. In our on-premise business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid- to high teens. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Talent Solutions and Marketing Solutions.

Growth continues to be impacted by the overall market environments for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry where we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the high teens driven by Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 17% and 18% or USD 25.1 billion to USD 25.4 billion. Revenue growth in constant currency will be approximately 1 point lower.

Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency with an increasing contribution from AI. Growth continues to be driven by Azure consumption business, and we expect the trends from Q1 to continue into Q2. Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in seat growth rates given the size of the installed base.

For H2, assuming the optimization and new workload trends continue and with the growing contribution from AI, we expect Azure revenue growth in constant currency to remain roughly stable compared to Q2. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth to be roughly flat with continued hybrid demand, particularly from licenses running in multi-cloud environments. In enterprise and partner services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. Now to more personal computing, which includes the net impact from the Activision acquisition.

We expect revenue of USD 16.5 billion to USD 16.9 billion. Windows OEM revenue growth should be mid- to high single digits with PC market unit volumes expected to look roughly similar to Q1. In devices, revenue should decline in the mid-teens as we continue to focus on our higher-margin premium products. In Windows Commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive revenue growth in the low to mid-teens.

Search and news advertising ex TAC revenue growth should be mid-single digits with roughly 4 points of negative impact from a third-party partnership. Growth should be driven by volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains and increasing Bing engagement as we expect the advertising spend environment to be similar to Q1. Reminder that this ex TAC growth will be roughly 4 points higher than overall search and news advertising revenue. And in gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid- to high 40s.

This includes roughly 35 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition, which, as a reminder, includes adjusting for the third-party to first-party content change noted earlier. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the mid- to high 50s, driven by roughly 50 points of net impact from the Activision acquisition. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS between USD 19.4 billion to USD 19.6 billion, including approximately $500 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets from the Activision acquisition.

We expect operating expense of USD 15.5 billion to USD 15.6 billion, including approximately $400 million from purchase accounting adjustments, integration and transaction-related costs from the Activision acquisition. Other income and expense should be roughly negative $500 million as interest income will be more than offset by interest expense, primarily due to a reduction in our investment portfolio balance and the issuance of short-term debt, both for the Activision acquisition. As a reminder, we are required to recognize gains or losses on our equity investments, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.

Now some additional thoughts on H2, as well as the full fiscal year. First, FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect FX to have no meaningful impact to full year revenue COGS or operating expense growth. Therefore, in H2, we expect FX to decrease revenue COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point.

Second, Activision. We expect approximately $900 million for purchase accounting adjustments, as well as integration and transaction-related costs in each quarter in H2. For our full FY '24, we remain committed to investing for the cloud and AI opportunity while also maintaining our disciplined focus on operating leverage. Therefore, as we add the net impact of Activision, inclusive of purchase accounting adjustments, as well as integration and transaction-related expenses, we continue to expect full year operating margins to remain flat year over year.

In closing, with our strong start to FY '24, I am confident that as a team, we will continue to deliver healthy growth in the year ahead, driven by our leadership in commercial cloud and our commitment to lead the AI platform wave. With that, let's go to Q&A, Brett.

Questions & Answers:

Operator

[Operator instructions] One moment please while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.

Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, and very nice quarter. The pace of innovation you guys have been putting out has been pretty amazing. And new products are like garnering traction probably faster than we had expected on our side of the equation.

But we're also working in an overall spending environment that remains volatile at that, and I think investors are getting more concerned on it. So, two questions on this. One, based on sort of the new products and the innovation, do you think you guys can sustain the type of commercial growth that we saw in Q1 as we go through the year? Or is the environment too tricky for that? And then when it relates to investment, Amy, you've been able to keep overall opex growth very low, and it was very low this quarter. At some point, should we be thinking about a return to a more aggressive investment behind all this product innovation?

Satya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer

Maybe I can start, Keith, and Amy, you can add to it. Overall, there are multiple things, Keith, that are all happening, obviously, simultaneously. If you just take Azure and try to characterize where is the growth for Azure coming from or what sort of drivers for Azure numbers, there are three things all happening in parallel. Like, for example, take cloud migrations.

A good reminder of where we are and even the core cloud migration story is the new Oracle announcement. Once we announce that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of unlock from new customers who have significant Oracle estates that have not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to run the GUI with the rest of the app estate in one single cloud. And so, we're excited about that. So, in some sense, even the financial services sector, for example, is a good place where there's a lot of Oracle that still needs to move to the cloud.

Second thing, of course, is the workloads start, then workloads get optimized and then new workloads start. And that cycle continues. We'll lap some of those optimization cycles that were fairly extreme perhaps in the second half of our fiscal. And the third thing is, for us, that's unique and different is new workload starts around AI.

Given our leadership position, we are seeing complete new project starts, which are AI projects. And as you know, AI projects are not just about AI meters. They have lots of other cloud meters as well. So, that sort of gives you one side of what's happening in terms of enterprise.

The other piece is on the SaaS side. Obviously, again, this is a new product that's going to go through the enterprise adoption cycle. The results are on productivity, which we demonstrated with GitHub Copilot is what's giving us good confidence and our customers, more importantly, good confidence around what these products represent in terms of value. And so, we are in the very, very early innings there.

And so, we look forward to seeing the traction for these products going forward.

Amy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer

Keith, maybe just a few things to add, and then I'll talk a little bit about the operating leverage, which is the second part of your question. In general, we saw very consistent execution from Q4 to Q1, and that's what we're talking about into Q2. I think that speaks to our value prop, which is where Satya went. It speaks to making sure that customers are getting a very quick return on value, real productivity improvement, real savings so that when we're asking at renewal or talking about E5 upgrades or talking about AI services that those come with real promises of high-value scenarios.

And so, I think that is an important piece as you think about stability in commercial demand. And then if you think about the nature of your question, it was partially why I talked about in my full year guidance that now even with the addition of Activision and purchase accounting impacts, integration impacts, we still feel confident we can deliver consistent operating margins to last year. And it speaks to, I think, some of the improvements we're making in Azure and even Microsoft 365 gross margins, even in the core of the commercial cloud. It speaks to the pace at which we are delivering AI revenue with the increasing cost expense and capital investment ahead with the demand we see.

And although you're right, our operating expense comparables in H2 get more challenging than in H1, we're really focused on making sure that every dollar we put and commit is back to the priorities we talked about, which is commercial cloud leadership and leading the AI wave. And so, I think that focus is really helping on both execution and leverage.

Keith Weiss -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst

Excellent. Thank you, guys.

The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed.

Mark Moerdler -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst

Thank you very much and congratulations on a really strong quarter. AI has been far stronger than expected, beat your guidance for Azure this quarter. And while you discussed higher utilization and more GPUs have helped, has the fact that Microsoft has a full AI dev stack, Copilot reference architecture and plug-in architecture, been a meaningful factor not just from a revenue perspective, but also even potentially from a margin perspective? In addition, can you give us any color on whether Azure GPU is predominantly model training? Or are we seeing a lot of inferencing yet from clients? Thanks.

Satya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer

OK. Thank you for the question, Mark. Yes, it is true that we have -- the approach we have taken is a full-stack approach all the way from whether it's ChatGPT or Bing chat or all our Copilots all share the same model. So, in some sense, one of the things that we do have is very, very high leverage of the one model that we used, which we trained, and then the one model that we are doing inferencing at scale.

And that advantage sort of trickles down all the way to both utilization internally, utilization of third parties. And also over time, you can see that sort of stack optimization all the way to the silicon because the abstraction layer to which the developers are riding is much higher up than no-level kernels, if you will. So, therefore, I think there is a fundamental approach we took, which was a technical approach of saying we'll have Copilots and Copilot stack all available. That doesn't mean we don't have people doing training for open-source models or proprietary models.

We also have a bunch of open-source models. We have a bunch of fine-tuning happening, a bunch of RLHF happening. So, there's all kinds of ways people use it, but the thing is we have scale leverage of one large model that was trained and one large model that's been used for inference across all our first-party SaaS apps, as well as our API in our Azure AI service.

Amy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer

And the reason, Mark, that's important is that it means, even beyond the point Satya made, is that when it comes to our ability to leverage the infrastructure that we're building out, we don't really have a preference in terms of how people are utilizing that infrastructure, whether it's through all the means that Satya mentioned. It gives us a good opportunity to see quick conversion into revenue.

Satya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I mean one other thing I would just add to perhaps Mark's question, as well as Keith's is in a -- this platform transition, I think, is very important for us to be very disciplined on both I'll call it our tech stack, as well as our capital spend all to be concentrated. The lesson learned from the cloud side is this, we're not running a conglomerate of different businesses. It's all one tech stack up and down Microsoft's portfolio.

And that I think is going to be very important because that discipline, given what the spend like -- it will look like for this AI transition, any business that's not disciplined about their capital spend accruing across all their businesses could run into trouble.

Mark Moerdler -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst

Brent Thill -- Jefferies -- Analyst

Thanks. Amy, good to see the 12% growth. Many investors are asking can you sustain double-digit growth, especially with the stronger AI boost coming in the next several quarters.

Amy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer

I think looking at our -- as I said, Q1 was a strong start to the year. Q2 certainly implies that. We talked about stability for Azure into the second half of the year looking at -- and in line with what we're seeing for Q2. And so, I think we feel good about our ability to execute, but more importantly, our ability to continue to take share.

The next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed.

Raimo Lenschow -- Barclays -- Analyst

Hey, thank you. You sound very optimistic about the opportunity in the Office space with Copilot coming out now very soon. Can you speak a little bit about the -- what you're seeing there in the customer base that tested this already in terms of how excited they were, the special features there? And what does it mean in terms of adoption curve for that going forward once you go GA in 1st of November? Thank you.

Satya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer

No, thanks for the question, Raimo. The good news is twofold. One is the fact that, what, 40% of the Fortune 100 are already in the preview and are using the product. And I think you all have also done lots of checks.

And the feedback is very, very positive. And in fact, the interesting thing is it's not any one tool, right, which is the feedback even sort of is very clear that it's the all up. You just keep hitting the Copilot button across every surface, right, whether it's in Word to create documents, in Excel to do analysis or PowerPoint or Outlook or Teams. Like clearly, the Teams Meeting, which is an intelligent recap, right? It's not just a dumb transcript.

It's like having a knowledge base of all your meetings that you can query and add to essentially the knowledge terms of your enterprise. And so, we are seeing broad usage across and the interesting thing is by different functions, whether it's in finance or in sales by roles. We have seen productivity gains like we saw with developers in GitHub Copilot. So, that's the data.

We are very excited about our Ignite Conference, where we will talk a lot more about all of the use cases and where's the value and give more prescriptive guidance on how people can deploy. But so far so good as far as the data is and the feedback is. And of course, this is an enterprise product. I mean at the end of the day, we are grounded on enterprise cycle times in terms of adoption and ramp.

And it's incrementally priced. So, therefore, that all will apply still. But at least for something completely new, to have this level of usage already and this level of excitement is something we're very, very pleased with.

Next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed.

Karl Keirstead -- UBS -- Analyst

OK, great. Thanks. Amy, congrats on the 28% constant currency Azure growth. That's terrific.

I wanted to press you a little bit on the outlook for Azure. You're obviously guiding to a 1- to 2-point decel in December and then stable thereafter. But why would it be stable? Why wouldn't it accelerate in the second half of your fiscal year if the AI contribution is increasing as you bring on more GPU capacity? Is this a function of perhaps continued core ex-AI Azure spend optimization continuing or maybe even getting slightly worse? Why couldn't we see some upside in that Azure number? I know you're trying to be conservative, but I'd just love to understand it. Thanks so much.

Amy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks, Karl. A couple of things as I talked about Q2 and then into H2. We've been very consistent that the optimization trends have been consistent for us through a couple of quarters now. Customers are going to continue to do that.

It's an important part of running workloads. That is not new. There obviously were some quarters where it was more accelerated. But that is a pattern that is and has been a fundamental part of having customers, both make new room for new workload adoption and continue to build new capabilities.

And so, I think that impact remains through the rest of the year, and my view is unchanged on that. And then, of course, I think the key component has always been new workload starts. And at the scale we're talking about, being able to have stability in our Azure business does mean that we will have a lot of new workload starts. And primarily, we're expecting those to come from AI workloads.

But AI workloads don't just use our AI services. They use data services and they use other things. And so, that combination, I think, looking on a competitive basis, we feel good about our execution, we feel good about taking share, and we feel good about consistent trends. And so, I feel good about that guide and what it says about where we are on share.

Karl Keirstead -- UBS -- Analyst

Terrific, thanks.

The next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed.

Brad Sills -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst

Oh, wonderful. Thank you so much. Very impressive to see the Office 365 Commercial seat growth hanging in here in that double-digit range. It's very impressive just given the scale of that business, we think of Office as having such a dominant market position.

Curious how you think about the -- where that seat is coming from and how many more of those seats are out there to go get.

Amy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks for that question. Maybe I'll take that. Satya, if you want to add. In general, our seat growth has -- it does come from all segments but with a particular strength in small and midsized businesses, as well as what we call the frontline worker opportunity.

And then that has been, I would say, looking back a number of quarters, where the majority of our seat growth has gone. And while obviously, it's slowed a bit, to your point, I think the fact that we're still able to add seats at this level speaks to the broadening nature of what Microsoft 365 needs. It's more applicable to more people. And so, I think many people have thought, oh, my goodness, you've got a lot of customers already.

And we look and say, how many people when you expand what Microsoft 365 means, whether it's security or it means analytics or it means Teams, it means lots of things and an expanding definition, it applies to more types of workers. And frankly, the value is such, especially on the small business front, where it's to the point where I think people feel like it's a great way to spend even the spend money they have is this remains a pretty compelling offer.

The next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.

Brent Bracelin -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Thank you. Good afternoon. One thing that really stood out to me was the intelligent cloud segment operating margin. These came in, I think, at the highest level in six years despite elevated AI investments.

Was there a one-time tailwind here that helped? Or are you at the point where Azure has got to kind of scale where Microsoft could sustain high margins even with an ambitious AI investment cycle?

Amy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer

Thanks for that question. I think there are a couple of things going on. I would say, in particular, this was a very good leverage quarter in that segment. Number one, the Azure revenue growth and the stability we're seeing in it absolutely is a help to operating leverage.

The second component of that is our core Azure business. The team continues to deliver thoughtful gross margin improvement across both technical decisions, software implementations. Our teams on the infrastructure build side have done really good work to deliver that. And so, that's been helpful as well.

And then, of course, on operating expenses, there's been a good focus on continuing even within that segment to make sure we're focusing that work leading in the AI transition with Azure. And so, you're right, even as we're investing in AI infrastructure, which will and should show up as revenue, it will also show up in COGS and still deliver good margin. But this does have a slightly, as I talked about earlier, easier comp in Q1 and Q2 given it was some of our highest growth operating expense quarters in our company's history a year ago.

Brent Bracelin -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst

Makes sense. Thank you.

Brett Iversen -- General Manager, Investor Relations

Thanks, Brent. Joe, we have time for one last question.

Operator

The last question will come from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho. Please proceed.

Gregg Moskowitz -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst

OK. Thank you very much for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up to what Brent was just asking about but on the gross margin line. Amy, the Microsoft Cloud gross margin is up 2 points year over year, excluding the useful life change, a little more improvement than we've seen in some time.

And some investors were worried that it might go in the other direction given increased AI investments. And so, as you look forward, do you think that you could drive some continued gross margin improvement over the medium term and even as higher capex will filter into the model? Thanks.

Amy Hood -- Chief Financial Officer

Yeah. Let me break that into two components because they're both important, and it's a really good question, Gregg. On our core business, the core Azure business, the core Office 365, M365 Business Dynamics business, they continue to deliver gross margin year-over-year improvements in the core. And so, that, like in other quarters, has helped this quarter.

In addition, what Satya mentioned earlier in a question, and I just want to take every chance to reiterate it, if you have a consistent infrastructure from the platform all the way up through its layers that every capital dollar we spend, if we optimize revenue against it, we will have great leverage because wherever demand shows up in the layers, whether it's at the SaaS layer, whether it's at the infrastructure layer, whether it's for training workloads, we're able to quickly put our infrastructure to work generating revenue on our Bing workloads. I mean I should have mentioned all the consumer workloads use the same frame. And so, when you think about our investment in AI, yes, it will -- because we're committed to leading this wave and see demand, you will see that impact in COGS growth. But what we're committed to doing is making sure it's highly leveraged and making sure you see the same growth in revenue.

And I think on occasion, you may see something tick up 1 or 2 points and the other one not quite get there. But the point is it's going to be very well pared because of the choices we've made over the past, frankly, numerous years to get to a point where that infrastructure is consistent.

Satya Nadella -- Chief Executive Officer

And I'll just add that it will be very well pared at the company level. I realize all of you care a lot about each one of our segments and each one of our KPIs, and I do too. But at the end of the day, our stack and the way it works, the way we do our capital allocation, the way we think about even the optimization of the demand to utilization, is across the entirety of all of our segments and all of our products.

Gregg Moskowitz -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst

Very helpful. Thank you.

More MSFT analysis

All earnings call transcripts",The Motley Fool,Motley Fool Transcribing,2023-10-24
Microsoft Stock (NASDAQ:MSFT): Its Valuation Just Doesn’t Make Sense,"In the constantly evolving tech industry, tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has found a way to stay relevant year after year. Microsoft is undoubtedly one of the best businesses in the world, and financial metrics prove this, but that doesn’t necessarily mean you should buy its stock. Near an all-time high, Microsoft’s valuation just doesn’t make sense. Therefore, we are neutral on the stock.

The Numbers Point Toward an Amazing Business

There are several ways one could analyze Microsoft stock and justify buying it. MSFT bulls can talk about Microsoft’s AI and cloud computing growth potential, which is indeed very promising, as the company has a 49% stake in OpenAI (the owner of ChatGPT) and operates Microsoft Azure, a growing cloud computing platform. But investors can also simply point to the firm’s financial metrics to prove how good of a business it really is, and that’s what we’ll do.

Microsoft’s Competitive Advantage Can be Quantified

A great way of determining if a company has a competitive advantage is by looking at its gross profit margin because it represents the premium that consumers are willing to pay over the cost of a product or service. An expanding gross margin indicates that a sustainable competitive advantage is present. If an existing company has no edge, then new entrants would gradually take away market share, leading to decreasing gross margins as pricing wars ensue to remain competitive.

Microsoft’s gross margin has been trending higher since Fiscal 2016, rising from 64% in 2016 to 69.4% for the trailing 12 months. As a result, its rising gross margin indicates that a competitive advantage is present.

Microsoft’s Competitive Edge Allows the Company to Print Cash

Microsoft’s competitive advantage has allowed the firm to operate very efficiently over the past decade and rake in the cash. To measure its efficiency, we’ll take a look at MSFT’s cash return on invested capital (known as CROIC, calculated as free cash flow divided by invested capital).

Story continues

Essentially, this measures how much free cash flow the company generates for every dollar of capital it invests. For the last 12 months, MSFT had a CROIC of 21.9%, which is well above the IT sector average of 3.2%. So, for every $1 the company invested in the past year, it generated 21.9 cents of free cash flow. Its five-year average CROIC of 24.2% is impressive as well. For context, Microsoft generated a whopping $63.2 billion worth of free cash flow for the trailing 12 months.

This excess cash can be used to return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, as MSFT already does, although not in large amounts.

The Caveat: The Valuation is Unattractive

As mentioned above, Microsoft is a great business, but you can’t just buy a business at any price. Valuation matters. There are a few reasons why MSFT’s valuation isn’t attractive. First, its forward P/E ratio of 32.9x is high. It’s actually higher than its five-year average forward P/E of 29.2x, and that’s exactly the problem.

We’re now in a higher interest rate environment than usual, which means that investors should be expecting higher returns from stocks since they can get relatively high interest rates from risk-free government bonds. Therefore, it doesn’t quite make sense that MSFT has a higher valuation now, in a high-rate environment, than it did when interest rates were much lower.

Adding to this, MSFT’s five-year average earnings-per-share CAGR comes in at 35.4% and its three-year CAGR is 18.9%. Meanwhile, the firm’s EPS is now expected to grow by 14% and 15% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. So, lower growth is expected going forward, but the valuation is higher than usual? This just isn’t a great setup, in our opinion. And remember — these EPS forecasts factor in MSFT’s AI and cloud computing potential.

Is MSFT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, MSFT comes in as a Strong Buy based on 30 Buys and just one Hold assigned in the past three months. The average MSFT stock price target of $408.76 implies 10.6% downside potential.

If you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell MSFT stock, the most accurate analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research, with an average return of 31.77% per rating and a 97% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.

The Takeaway

Microsoft is a top-notch tech business, and this can be proven by looking at some of its financials. However, its valuation is too high for our liking, and we think there are better opportunities elsewhere. To conclude, we’re not saying that Microsoft stock will crash, but we believe that, at current levels, investors shouldn’t expect the same kind of gains from MSFT stock that they have become accustomed to. As a result, we’re staying on the sidelines until the stock falls to a more reasonable level.

Disclosure",Yahoo Finance,,
The AI Race: Have Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) Already Won?,"Without question the market has developed a seemingly insatiable appetite for artificial intelligence (AI) technology and the companies that can lead this new frontier. Seen as the promising future, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems like humans by using (among other things) an advanced form of computer processing which includes machine learning and neural networks.

Given these immense capabilities, investor interest in AI stocks, namely Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA), have skyrocketed over the past few months as the race to control the technology forges ahead. The money-making potential is immense. The generative AI market is currently growing at 42% and could hit $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. The bulk of the revenue growth from generative AI, estimated $247 billion by 2032, will come from demand for the infrastructure needed to train AI models.

“The release of consumer-focused artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT and Google’s Bard is set to fuel a decade-long boom,” noted Bloomberg. What's more, estimates suggests that the AI-assisted digital ads business could reach $192 billion in annual revenue by 2032, while revenue from AI servers could hit $134 billion. But just like other market trendy buzzwords that have captivated the investor community, not every company that puts out an “AI press release,” staking a claim of their piece of the pie, will thrive.

But if judging solely by their growth forecasts and stocks prices, there are two clear leaders at the moment: Microsoft and Nvidia. Microsoft’s AI advances became known with ChatGPT by way if its $10 billion investment in Open AI, giving Microsoft 33% ownership of the company. Many analysts referred to Microsoft’s AI bet as an ""iPhone moment.” Since then, ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing technology in history, hitting 2 billion users after only six months. Estimates suggests it can reach 3.4 billion global users by the end of 2023.

Microsoft’s AI advances with its AI integration is being regarded as the best among the cloud giants - a group that includes Amazon (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG , GOOGL). Estimates are calling for Microsoft ’s AI growth prospects to get a 33% boost. The challenge for investors in terms of valuation of Microsoft stock, what’s does that AI growth prospect equate to? Currently trading near all-time highs of $342, MSFT stock has risen 43% year to date, besting the 14% rise in the S&P 500 index.

Microsoft stock is more than 20% overvalued, according to several valuation metrics, including P/E which puts its fair value closer to $265. And that’s even when factoring three years worth of growth. The biggest risk in my book would be to assume that any of these conventional valuation metrics matter today. Microsoft’s AI-driven growth could push the stock towards $550 in the next five years, yielding 60% return or 12% annually.

Nvidia, which has soared 198% this year, skyrocketed close to 30% after its blowout first quarter earnings results and better-than-expected Q2 guidance. The stock gained $184 billion in one day, vaulting the stock north of a trillion-dollar valuation. Nvidia’s Q2 guidance and its proclaimed leading position as an AI chip supplier got investors excited, guiding for Q2 revenue of $11 billion, crushing estimates for revenue of $8.5 billion.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has declared that generative AI represents an “iPhone moment.” Investors have since recognized the importance of Nvidia’s GPU data center accelerators which can potentially serve as the backbone for generative AI infrastructure. On the Q1 conference call with analysts, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress affirmed that belief that data centers will inevitably switch to Nvidia’s products incorporating AI. “Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing,” Kress said.

Meanwhile, CEO Huang, in a press release, issued the sort of outlook that suggests Nvidia’s leadership in Generative AI is all but assured. “A trillion dollars of installed global data infrastructure will transition…to accelerated computing as companies race to apply AI to every product, service, and business process,” wrote Huang. The demand for Nvidia’s GPUs based on its Hopper and Ampere architecture was noticeable in its just-announced results.

Nvidia continues to enjoy not only tons of AI tailwinds, but also the company’s fundamentals continues to improve evidenced by its margin improvement. As such, despite the stock reaching all-time high levels, the best play here is to stay invested and add on any dips. NVDA stock is poised to reach $500 by the end of the year.

All told, this new AI frontier is getting crowded. It remains to be seen which companies ascend and which ones falter. But while AI has tons of room for growth, Microsoft and Nvidia have planted their flags and staked their leadership in this new frontier.

Is Microsoft (MSFT) Still a Great Investment Choice?,"White Brook Capital Partners, an investment management firm, released its third quarter 2023 investor letter, a copy of which can be downloaded here. White Brook Capital Partners maintains its outperformance against the S&P Midcap 400 year to date, boasting a 6.49% increase compared to the index’s 4.28% gain.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, White Brook Capital mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and explained its insights for the company. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Redmond, Washington-based multinational technology corporation with a $2.7 trillion market capitalization. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered a 55.33% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 51.97%. The stock closed at $372.52 per share on December 08, 2023.

Here is what White Brook Capital has to say about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it’s relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.”

What Does Microsoft Corporation's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Share Price Indicate?,"Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of US$359 and falling to the lows of US$316. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Microsoft's current trading price of US$321 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Microsoft’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft

Is Microsoft Still Cheap?

The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 11% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $361.14, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. What's more, Microsoft’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.

Can we expect growth from Microsoft?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Microsoft's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 51%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in MSFT’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?

Story continues

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on MSFT, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Microsoft.

What Is Microsoft Worth?

According to my valuation model, Microsoft seems to be fairly priced at around 0.08% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Microsoft today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $377.14, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. In addition to this, Microsoft has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.

What does the future of Microsoft look like?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 49% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Microsoft. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? MSFT’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company.

As indicated by the fund, following the second-best first half of the century, the market bulls faced challenges in the third quarter of 2023. The S&P 500 recorded a loss of 3.27% in the three months ending September 30th, 2023. Analysts attribute this downturn to the surge in interest rates stemming from the Federal Reserve's measures to control inflation. The Canadian market fared slightly better, experiencing a loss of only 2.7% during the quarter.

""We have mentioned in the last letter that the “magnificent seven”, including Microsoft Corporation, dominated the performance of the S&P 500. We might have left you with the feeling that we are bearish because we don’t find the Magnificent 7 attractive. Let us make it clear: we are just not so pessimistic as to believe there are only 7 growth opportunities in the entire global equity market. In fact, we are optimists and think opportunity is abundant. Just not in everyone’s current 7 favorite stocks.”

MSFT: Is Microsoft (MSFT) a Good Buy for August?,"Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) has been at the forefront of the AI-driven tech surge this year, with shares soaring over 40% year-to-date. The optimism surrounding the potential of AI has also stimulated record-breaking growth for the Nasdaq 100 in the first half of the year.

The hype around the new era of technology shows no sign of abating. The latest Markets Live Pulse survey revealed that an impressive 77% of the 514 respondents plan to increase or maintain their tech stock exposure over the subsequent six months, potentially inflating market valuations further.

MSFT is well-positioned to exploit the accelerating AI trend as it innovates to create intelligent machines that complement human reasoning.

Earlier this year, MSFT introduced its Copilot service, integrating into its Microsoft 365 software suite, using generative AI that enables it to more efficiently compose emails, summarize documents, analyze spreadsheet data, etc., and unlock a new wave of productivity growth. Consequently, it announced a new artificial intelligence subscription service for Microsoft 365 this month.

Additionally, significant upgrades were made to Bing Chat, Microsoft’s AI-powered chatbot.

While Microsoft is lagging behind Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) in cloud infrastructure, CEO Satya Nadella believes his company is leading when it comes to new artificial intelligence workloads such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Despite its elevated valuation, a closer look at its robust financial metrics suggests a promising buying opportunity for investors seeking solid returns and long-term value.

Exploring Microsoft Corporation’s Earnings Rebound: Trends and Growth in Key Financial Metrics, 2020-2023

The trailing-12-month net income of MSFT showed a significant upward trend over the three-year period from September 2020 to June 2023. The data series commenced with a net income of $47.50 billion in September 2020, which has since experienced notable fluctuations.

A surge was observed in September 2021, when the net income peaked at $67.88 billion.

Despite a slight drop to $67.45 billion in December 2021, the net income ascended to reach its highest value of $72.74 billion in June 2022.

Notably, after reaching this peak, the net income experienced two consecutive quarters of decrease, falling to $69.79 billion in September 2022 and further to $67.45 billion in December 2022.

In contrast to the previous trend, the P/S increased from December 2022 to June 2023, growing from 8.83 to 11.59.

Growth Rate: – Notably, using the first and the last recorded values, the P/S increased from 10.96 in September 2020 to 11.59 in June 2023. This represents a modest growth rate of approximately 5.7%.

Does Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Have High Growth Potential?,"Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its “Alger Spectra Fund” third quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the third quarter, the fund underperformed the Russell 3000 Growth Index. The energy and consumer staples sectors were the contributors to the fund’s relative performance in the quarter, while communication services and health care detracted. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2023.

Alger Spectra Fund highlighted stocks like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the third quarter 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a multinational software company that develops, and licenses software, services, devices, and solutions. On November 3, 2023, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock closed at $352.80 per share. One-month return of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was 6.97%, and its shares gained 54.83% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a market capitalization of $2.622 trillion.

Alger Spectra Fund made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a beneficiary of corporate America's transformative digitization. Microsoft's CEO expects technology spending as a percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to jump from about 5% now to 10% in 10 years and that Microsoft will continue to capture market share within the technology sector. The t company operates through three segments: Productivity and Business Processes (Office, LinkedIn, and Dynamics), Intelligent Cloud (Server Products and Cloud Services, Azure, and Enterprise Services), and More Personal Computing (Windows, Devices, Gaming, and Search). During the period, the company reported fiscal fourth quarter results that were slightly below expectations. This was largely because anticipations were high due to the company's robust year-to-date share price performance, which was buoyed by enthusiasm surrounding Al. Although quarterly revenues and earnings beat consensus estimates, management pointed out that they would be ramping up capital expenditures to support Al-driven operational growth. Notably, the company witnessed significant growth in its Intelligent Cloud segment as Azure continues to expand its market share. Despite the encouraging results, demand challenges stemming from companies looking to optimize their cloud spending led to a deceleration in cloud growth when compared to the previous quarter. Acknowledging that cloud optimization may curb the company's growth in the short term: we remain confident about the company's prospects going forward, particularly in the realm of Al adoption. Further, CEO Satya Nadella has recently indicated that substantial revenue contributions from Al will begin to materialize around the first half of 2024.""

How A Big Artificial Intelligence Investment Could Pay Off For Microsoft,"Microsoft (MSFT) is in talks to increase its investment in artificial intelligence startup OpenAI by $10 billion in a move to make its Bing search engine a stronger rival to Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, according to reports. MSFT stock edged up amid the reports while GOOGL stock also rose.

X

Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019. Microsoft's investment would be part of a new funding round for the AI startup.

OpenAI's technologies include ChatGPT, a chatbot that could make Microsoft Bing a stronger challenger to Google's internet search, and image-generation program Dall-E2.

The software giant also could integrate ChatGPT into its Bing internet search app. ChatGPT provides human-like answers to questions and generates documents.

MSFT Stock: Boost For Bing, Azure Cloud?

The Bing search engine holds nearly 9% of the market, while Google commands roughly 84%, according to Statista. Meanwhile, Google designed its search tools to provide links to websites and advertising.

Microsoft has integrated Dall-E2 tools into its graphics design software. Dall-E2 converts written text into pictures. Other OpenAI tools could be built into email platform Outlook and office productivity tools such as Word.

In a recent report, Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan said the OpenAI partnership could boost Microsoft's Azure cloud business.

""We expect dozens of new services from OpenAI/ChatGPT leveraging Azure's robust infrastructure in a virtual cycle,"" Horan said. ""These services will include true digital assistants, AI-based legal, accounting, financial services and dozens more. This consumer AI will then be used in enterprise (applications) in equally surprising ways.""

OpenAI has used Microsoft's Azure cloud computing unit to develop ""generative AI"" software tools that create new content from large public data sets. The startup uses machine learning techniques to train AI models. Further, the machine learning software gobbles up text, images, voice recordings, programming code and other forms of data.

A digestive process requiring powerful computer chips builds computer algorithms that pro-actively create new content. Most AI models are limited to making predictions based on pattern recognition. Internet search is just one application of generative AI. The technology also is finding applications in marketing/copywriting, drug and material development, video gaming and digital art.

GOOGL Stock: Big Artificial Intelligence R&D Budget

MSFT stock gained 0.8% to 228.85 on the stock market today. GOOGL stock edged up 0.5% to 88.42.

Meanwhile, Google's cloud computing unit has partnered with startup Cohere, a rival of OpenAI.

Also, Google owns DeepMind Technologies, a U.K.-based AI research laboratory. Google has developed generative AI tools called Language Model for Dialog Applications, known as LaMDA, which uses technology similar to OpenAI's.

According to a Bank of America report, Google has invested some $120 billion in artificial intelligence and cloud computing since 2016.

Microsoft (MSFT) Q1 2024 Earnings: What to Expect,"Since reaching tis all-time high of $366 in mid July, shares of Microsoft (MSFT) have fallen as much as 15%. Currently trading at around $326, the stock is still up an impressive 36% year to date, besting the 10% rise in the S&P 500 index, even with a decline of close to 10% over the past three months.

The enterprise software and cloud giant is scheduled to report first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. Microsoft's stock outperformance, even amid the recent struggles in tech, continue to be driven by the company’s leadership position in AI, thanks to its multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. More recently, the company unveiled Microsoft 365 Copilot, an AI-powered version of its productivity platform.

As a result, the software and cloud giant have been a top pick among among investors and analysts. Microsoft made no secret that AI would be a key source of its future growth. In September, while speaking at Goldman Sach's Communacopia + Technology conference, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said that it ""absolutely should be the fastest $10 billion business we've ever built” when referencing Generative AI. Ahead of the tech giant's quarterly results Tuesday, Citigroup analysts agrees.

Citing stabilization in IT budgets and a ramp up in revenue related to generative artificial intelligence, the analysts expects Microsoft to deliver ""accelerating"" total revenue and profitability. Its Azure cloud platform and the availability of Microsoft 365 Copilot are also expected to see growth tailwinds. As for the latter, which is priced at $30 per month, some analysts believe it can boost Microsoft’s fiscal 2025 revenue by as much as $9 billion. On Tuesday, the company’s guidance will gauge how confident its management feels about that growth potential.

For the quarter that ended September, the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant is expected to earn $2.52 per share on revenue of $51.72 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $2.35 per share on $49.61 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending June, earnings are projected to rise 5.7% year over year to $10.37 per share, while full-year revenue of $222.33 billion would mark a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.

The company’s push into artificial intelligence by way of its $10 billion investment in Open AI is the “x-factor” in the market’s renewed optimism. AI is expected to fuel Microsoft’s market share among enterprise customers, not only for cloud adoption but also in its search capabilities. OpenAI recently updated its popular ChatGPT chatbot, bringing the ""Browse with Bing"" feature to all users. The app is now linked to the internet and offers browsing capabilities via Microsoft’s Bing for all users.

It remains to be seen how much traction Bing generates, compared to Google, but Bank of America analyst Brad Sills who has a Buy rating on the stock and $405 price target, loves Microsoft’s strategy. In a recent note to investors, Sills said he expects Microsoft to post ""modest"" upside, with catalysts coming later in the year. Citing recent checks, Sills said he sees ""sustained, healthy"" new workloads for Azure.

In the Q4, the company earned $2.69 per share, topping Wall Street estimates by 14 cents, while revenue of $56.2 billion rose 8.34% year over year, surpassing estimates by $700 million. Revenue was driven by 26% rise in Intelligent Cloud revenue to $24 billion, while revenue from Productivity and Business Processes, which includes Office commercial and consumer products and cloud services, rose 12% year over year to $18.3 billion.

Microsoft’s performance and execution makes the stock a must-own for any portfolio. Microsoft stock has the potential to reach $500 per share, if or when Copilot adoption reaches double-digit percentage growth annually, and AI development becomes a normal enterprise line item expense.

Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Microsoft (MSFT) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

Over the past month, shares of this software maker have returned +14.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Microsoft falls in, has gained 14.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Microsoft is expected to post earnings of $2.75 per share, indicating a change of +18.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +4.7% over the last 30 days.

The consensus earnings estimate of $11.13 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +13.5%. This estimate has changed +2.1% over the last 30 days.

Story continues

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.71 indicates a change of +14.2% from what Microsoft is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Microsoft.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Projected Revenue Growth

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For Microsoft, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $61.02 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $242.26 billion and $274.82 billion estimates indicate +14.3% and +13.4% changes, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Microsoft reported revenues of $56.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.8%. EPS of $2.99 for the same period compares with $2.35 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $54.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.9%. The EPS surprise was +12.83%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Microsoft is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Microsoft. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

MSFT: 3 Big Reasons Why Microsoft May Not Be A Buy After All,"Both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 closed right at recent highs on Friday. The equally weighted S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 still have a way to go before nearing recent highs, however.

The mega-cap stocks like Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft have been the huge outperformers this year which accounts to the divergence between cap weighted QQQ and equal weighted QQQE.

Friday, though, finally showed some struggles for some of these mega-cap names even with the indices closing higher. Microsoft (MSFT), one of the mega-cap leaders, was actually down with both the S&P 500 and QQQ sharply higher.

Has the time arrived to begin to fade the rally in these red-hot names? Let’s take a look at Microsoft using the POWR Options process to see if the manic melt-up may be starting to stall in MSFT.

POWR Options likes to use a combination of fundamental and technical analysis along with looking at implied volatility to uncover trade ideas that have a probabilistic edge. This fusion approach helps put the odds in your favor. No guarantee (this is trading, after all) but an edge.

Let’s take a quick walk through the approach using Microsoft as an example.

Valuation

Microsoft stock is getting pricey once again on a valuation basis. Current Price/Sales (P/S) ratio now stands at the highest level this year and the highest since January 2022.

This even though the 10-year Treasury yield is still over 4% and the Fed Funds rate is at 5.25% to 5.5%. Back in January 2022 (the last time MSFT carried such lofty multiples) the Federal Reserve hadn’t even begun to raise rates off zero and the 10-year yield was at just over 1.5%.

To me, such historic increases in interest rates should dampen valuation multiples in a significant way. Plus, a 2.78 trillion dollar market cap company like Microsoft carrying a nearly 13x P/S ratio is difficult to justify since growth rates will necessarily be lessened simply due to the law of large numbers.

Technicals

MSFT stock is also showing some weakness (finally) from a technical perspective. Shares are struggling to break past the $380 area. 9-day RSI reached an extreme at 80 but has since fallen back to 56. Bollinger Percent B exceeded 100 and is now at 61. MACD also reached an extreme but just generated a sell signal by going negative. A break below the 20-day moving average could lead to further downside as it has done in the past.

Implied Volatility

Implied volatility (IV) is hovering at the lowest levels of the past year. This means option prices are cheap. A year ago, the 75-day at-the-money puts were trading at just over a 30 IV. Now the same 75-day at-the-money puts are trading at just a 23 IV.

To put the puts in perspective, the MSFT $255 puts were priced at $13.10 on 12/4/2022 with MSFT stock at $255.02. Now, similar $375 puts are priced at $14.40 with MSFT stock at $374.51. So, the 75-day puts are only $1.30 higher now even though Microsoft stock is $120 points higher! The percentage cost of put protection-and put prices-has dropped considerably to say the least. From over 5% a year ago to under 4% now.

This is the trade idea generation process we use on a daily basis for the POWR Options Portfolio. Combine fundamental, technical and implied volatility analysis in a fusion format.

Investors and traders alike may want to look to buy puts on an overvalued and overbought MSFT stock. The stock price hasn’t ever been this expensive and the put prices this cheap in a very long time.

Baron Opportunity Fund made the following comment about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is the world’s largest software company. Microsoft was traditionally known for its Windows and Office products, but over the last five years, it has built an over $60 billion cloud business, including its Azure cloud infrastructure service and its Office 365 and Dynamics 365 cloud-delivered applications. The stock detracted from performance because Microsoft is the Fund’s largest holding and shares retreated 7.1% after strong first half performance. For the June quarter, Microsoft reported better-than-expected Azure results for the third straight period, highlighted by Azure revenue growing 27% in constant currency. Its computing division also beat expectations, with Windows revenue benefiting from an early back-to-school inventory build. Microsoft’s September quarter revenue guidance came in below Street expectations; however, with Azure effectively in line and demonstrating stabilization, but computing seeing the negative sequential impact of the pull-forward in back-to-school purchases. Looking at the big picture, Microsoft continues to execute at a high level, navigating a challenging macro backdrop while aggressively investing in long-term growth, and we remain confident that Microsoft is well positioned to leverage AI over the medium to long term as it infuses Open AI and other generative AI technologies across its entire product portfolio.”

Microsoft Stock Split: MSFT Share Price Surge After Sam Altman Hire From OpenAI Sets Stage for Ballmer-Era Repeat,"Sam Altman, the co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, a key figure in the artificial intelligence revolution, experienced a tumultuous series of events recently.

Initially dismissed by the company’s board on Friday, November 17, 2023, Altman’s departure was attributed to a board-conducted review, determining that he had not consistently communicated transparently, impeding the board’s ability to fulfill its responsibilities.

Consequently, the board stated it no longer had confidence in Altman’s leadership.

Following Altman’s ousting, OpenAI’s president and Altman ally, Greg Brockman, resigned, alongside three senior researchers. Subsequently, they, along with potentially hundreds of OpenAI employees, were reported to join Altman at Microsoft, which swiftly poached him to lead a new AI effort in the wake of a second leadership shakeup at OpenAI.

the mission continues https://t.co/d1pHiFxcSe — Sam Altman (@sama) November 20, 2023

However, the drama continued, as reported by the Verge on Monday, November 20, 2023. Altman and Brockman apparently expressed a willingness to return to OpenAI, provided the remaining board members who ousted Altman stepped down.

The mass departure of OpenAI staff, including influential figures like Ilya Sutskever, added substantial pressure on the board, with only two of the remaining three members needing to change their stance for a potential return.

Altman’s statement on X, “We are all going to work together some way or other,” suggests an ongoing struggle for resolution. Sources with direct knowledge of the situation revealed that Altman, Brockman, and the company’s investors are actively seeking a graceful exit for the board.

The Microsoft hiring announcement was characterized as a “holding pattern,” a temporary measure to address the crisis before the stock market opened on Monday, November 20, 2023. The situation remains fluid as stakeholders navigate a complex and evolving landscape.

Microsoft and Activision Blizzard: ATVI stock price still below MSFT offer as regulatory hurdles persist,"Will MSFT takeover of ATVI squelch competition? - Photo: Getty Images.

It’s a takeover which has been clouded by a myriad of challenges, from lawsuits to regulatory issues. Microsoft's (MSFT) $68.7bn (£56bn) takeover of gaming giant

Activision Blizzard (ATVI), is not only being hotly debated by global regulators but the ATVI stock price remains resolutely below the MSFT offer.

Back in January 2022, Microsoft announced plans to purchase Activision Blizzard for $69bn, or $95 a share. ATVI is currently trading at around $77 per share, as investors price in the risk that the takeover may never happen. Activision shareholders approved the deal in April 2022, with more than 98% of votes in favour.

With that said, unlike other tech stocks, the ATVI share price was up 15% last year. Microsoft's stock price plummeted 28% in 2022.

Gamers file lawsuit aganist MSFT takeover of ATVI

But ATVI's share price remaining below the MSFT offer is not the only issue that plagues this deal.

In December, Microsoft was hit with a further blow in a US court, when a private consumer lawsuit was filed claiming the technology giant’s purchase of the Call of Duty maker will unlawfully hinder competition in the video game market.

The complaint was filed in a California federal court with an administrative law judge, in the hope to stop Microsoft, which owns the Xbox console, from finalising one of the largest acquisitions in gaming history.

The complaint said: “This is a private antitrust action seeking an order of the Court prohibiting the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. by Microsoft Corporation as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. § 18). The threatened loss or damage to the Plaintiffs and to the public at-large by the merging of two giants in the video game industry is extensive and broad.”

“In addition to the elimination of a significant rival, the proposed acquisition may give Microsoft far-outsized market power in the video game industry and may enable

Microsoft to foreclose rivals to critical inputs and important markets.”

The plaintiffs named in the lawsuit are described as “individual citizens of the cities and states listed.”

“Each Plaintiff is a consumer of video games, all with the express interest and intent in ensuring that the industry remains competitive,” the lawsuit states.

“The potential acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft threatens loss and harm to the Plaintiffs, and to the public at large, of the salutary benefits of substantial

competition within the video game industry.”

But that's not the only concern. Global regulators are on a mission to also block the deal - it seems. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is seeking to block technology giant Microsoft from acquiring leading video game developer Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its blockbuster gaming franchises such as Call of Duty.

“The FTC alleges that the deal, Microsoft’s largest ever and the largest ever in the video gaming industry, would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox

gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business,” a FTC statement said.

The FTC highlights that MSFT has a history of acquiring and using valuable content in order to “suppress competition from rival consoles.”

This includes its acquisition of ZeniMax, the parent company of Bethesda Softworks (a well-known game developer).

“Microsoft decided to make several of Bethesda's titles including Starfield and Redfall Microsoft exclusives despite assurances it had given to European antitrust authorities that it had no incentive to withhold games from rival consoles,” the FTC statement added.

“Microsoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals,” said Holly Vedova, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition.

“We seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets.”

Sony (SNE) has, unsurprisingly, come out on the 'against' side, given its PlayStation console is in direct competition with Microsoft's X-Box. But Meta (META), owner of Facebook and Instagram said it has no problem with the deal.

Despite this rising tide of uncertainty, Microsoft (MSFT) Gaming CEO, Phil Spencer is upbeat about the takeover and in a Wall Street Journal Tech Live conference last year, Spencer said regulators investigating the deal have been ""fair and honest"" and he is confident the takeover will go through.

But not everyone is convinced that the deal will go as smoothly as MSFT hopes.

Activision Blizzard (ATVI) share price chart

Global regulators continue to interrogate MSFT and ATVI

Joshua Raymond, an investment expert wrote in a note: ""This deal was always at significant risk failure from Day One due to issues surrounding anti-competition and

the fact the US FTC has now moved to block the acquisition cements this view.”

“There has also been much evidence that the market was also expecting failure. Before the news emerged, Activision's share prices were still trading at a 20% discount on the $95 price offered by Microsoft. That tells you the market lacked belief the deal would get done.”

With that said, it's not just the FTC that Microsoft has to challenge, but European and UK regulators are scutinising this deal and there is risk it may fall apart.

On Friday, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) made the decision to extend the deadline of its inquiry into the deal until 26 April.

“In taking this decision, the Inquiry Group had regard to the scope and complexity of the investigation and the need to consider a large volume of evidence as well as main party and third party submissions,” Martin Coleman, Inquiry Group Chair said in a CMA statement.

EU antitrust regulators have also questioned the deal and quizzed game developers if they think that MSFT will block ATVI games once it has purchased the company.

But MSFT has had some good news.

Last month Chilean regulators approved the merger. It was announced last week that Chile’s fiscalia Nacional economica - The National economic Prosecutor’s office had cleared the deal following its phase one investigation.

MSFT takeover of ATVI is scheduled to complete this year, but a cloud hangs over the deal - which has caused a huge amount of controversy. From ATVI's low stock price, to global regulators and lawsuits damming the acquisition, MSFT still has a fight on its hands. With some of the biggest markets, such as the US, UK and Europe, all questioning whether the deal will squelch competition, it seems that MSFT’s ambitions to acquire ATVI hangs in the balance.",Capital.com,,

Microsoft Stock Earnings Preview: Can MSFT Beat Estimates?,"Microsoft has exceeded EPS estimates four quarters in a row. Will it be five?

Microsoft will report quarterly earnings on October 24 after the stock market closes at 3:05 p.m. Central Time.

The tech giant is expected to post EPS of $2.65 on $54.54 billion in revenue.

Microsoft has exceeded EPS estimates four quarters in a row.

The Activision-Blizzard acquisition has finally closed, securing Microsoft's big gaming and VR investment.

Microsoft (MSFT) stock has had a great 2023 so far, opening the year at $243.08 and sitting well above that mark at a current price of $327.

The stock is already up 35% on the year, and we've yet to approach the holiday season where new bonus money tends to hit the stock market—we'll see if the recent market selloff will scare investors away or entice them to invest in big-name tech stocks like Microsoft.

The stock price has a +-$14.68 expected move through next week based on current implied volatility, which encompasses the upcoming earnings announcement. The stock has a +-$28.04 expected move through the December monthly options cycle, which means this earnings week accounts for about half of the expected movement through nearly the rest of the year.

Bullish on Microsoft Earnings

Microsoft finally closed its $69 billion gaming deal with Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) which is the biggest gaming deal we've seen yet. It also bolstered its artificial intelligence efforts, which sets the company up for a nice positive narrative on this quarterly earnings call.

Microsoft beat earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates four quarters in a row, and revenue estimates 75% of the time during the same period. I don't see much of a negative sentiment with Microsoft earnings this time around with so much positive news, but we'll see what the market says on Tuesday.

Bearish on Microsoft Earnings

Observers have lofty expectations of a strong forecast during Microsoft's earnings call this quarter, and this shouldn't surprise anyone after the massive acquisition of Activision-Blizzard. With grand expectations come an easier path to disappointment though. If future guidance is weak and the tech giant fails to beat EPS and/or revenue expectations—or any other negative surprise becomes known—we could see this popular tech stock fall in value after the earnings announcement in this bleak stock market we've seen recently.

Should You Finally Consider Increasing Your Microsoft (MSFT) Shares?,"Jackson Peak Capital, an investment management firm, released its third quarter 2023 investor letter, a copy of which can be downloaded here. Established in March 2023, the firm observed its second full quarter of investment activity during Q3 2023. Despite challenging market conditions, Jackson Peak excelled in Q3, achieving a robust return of +11.8%. The quarter posed difficulties for the broader markets, but Jackson Peak's alternative long-short investment strategy proved successful, securing notable wins in each segment of the portfolio. Take a moment to review the fund's top 5 holdings to gain insights into their primary investment choices for 2023.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Jackson Peak Capital mentioned Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and explained its insights for the company. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a Redmond, Washington-based technology corporation with a $2.7 trillion market capitalization. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) delivered a 52.90% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 51.80%. The stock closed at $366.68 per share on November 13, 2023.

Here is what Jackson Peak Capital has to say about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""The Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)/Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) merger arbitrage came to a successful conclusion with the court denying the FTC’s preliminary injunction request. The deal subsequently received approval from the UK CMA and closed in October. The ATVI position was an example of “staying around the hoop” of a significant arb opportunity. At first, the position led to a small loss in Q2 when the UK CMA initially blocked the deal in April, but we stayed close to the case, analyzed the FTC trial and scaled up the ATVI position as it became apparent FTC had a weak case, meaning the probability of the deal going through was mispriced by the market since the companies would likely find a solution to work with the UK CMA (only global regulator who had an issue) if the FTC lost.""
