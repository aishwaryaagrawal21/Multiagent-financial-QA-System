What new messaging privacy features are being tested to protect teens from unwanted interactions on Instagram?,"Based on the data gathered, here are the new messaging privacy features being tested to protect teens from unwanted interactions on Instagram:

- Instagram, owned by Meta, is working on a significant feature to prevent nudity on the platform. This feature involves blurring abusive messages to protect teens from harmful content.
- Additionally, Meta is planning to introduce a chatbot version of Instagram influencers. This feature, known as ""Creator A.I.,"" will allow popular influencers to create AI bots of themselves to interact with the public and answer queries.

These features aim to enhance privacy and safety for teenagers using Instagram by reducing exposure to inappropriate content and providing a controlled interaction environment through AI chatbots.

We already show Safety Notices when adults who have shown potentially suspicious behavior message teens, and we restrict people over 19 years old from sending private messages to teens who don’t follow them. We’re now testing additional features to limit how people can interact with and message others who don’t follow them:\n\nBefore being able to message someone who doesn’t follow them, people must now send an invite to get their permission to connect. People can only send one invite at a time and can’t send more until the recipient accepts the invitation to connect.\n\nWe’ll limit these message request invites to text only, so people can’t send any photos, videos, or voice messages, or make calls, until the recipient has accepted the invite to chat. These changes mean people won’t receive unwanted photos, videos, or other types of media from people they don’t follow.\n\nNudging Teens to Manage Their Time on Facebook and Instagram\n\nWe want teens to feel good about the time they spend on our apps, which is why we’ve built features like Take a Break on Instagram. Soon, teens will also see a notification when they’ve spent 20 minutes on Facebook, prompting them to take time away from the app and set daily time limits. We’re also exploring a new nudge on Instagram that suggests teens close the app if they are scrolling Reels at night.\n\nIn January, we introduced Quiet Mode on Instagram, a new feature to help people focus and to encourage them to set boundaries with their friends and followers. For example, when you turn on Quiet Mode, you won’t receive any notifications, your profile’s activity status will change to let people know you’re in Quiet Mode, and we’ll automatically send an auto-reply when someone sends you a DM. We’re making Quiet Mode available to everyone on Instagram globally in the coming weeks.\n\nAdditional Parental Supervision Features on Instagram\n\nWe’ve added additional tools to Parental Supervision on Instagram to give parents more visibility into their teens’ experiences on the app and to prompt teens to have conversations with their parents with new notifications. These updates include:\n\nA new notice to teens after they’ve blocked someone. The notice encourages teens to add their parents to supervise their Instagram account as an extra layer of support. Through this notice, we’re meeting teens at specific moments to remind them how they can benefit from parental guidance when it comes to navigating their online interactions.\n\nIn addition to seeing which accounts their teen follows and is followed by, parents will now be able to see how many friends their teen has in common with those accounts. This will help parents understand how well their teen knows these accounts, and help prompt offline conversations about those connections.\n\nMore ways for parents to customize which notifications from Parental Supervision on Instagram they want to receive and how often they receive them.\n\nToday’s updates were designed to help teens feel in control of their online experiences and help parents feel equipped to support their teens.

With both the MI300X accelerator and MI300A APU, AMD is aiming to cover most of the accelerator market, whether clients just need a powerful GPU or a tightly-coupled GPU/CPU pairing.\n\nThe stakes for today\'s announcement are significant. The market for generative AI is all but hardware constrained at the moment, much to the benefit of (and profits for) AMD\'s rival NVIDIA. So AMD is hoping to capitalize on this moment to cut off a piece – perhaps a very big piece – of the market for generative AI accelerators. AMD has made breaking into the server space their highest priority over the last half-decade, and now, they believe, is their time to take a big piece of the server GPU market.\n\n12:56PM EST - We\'re here in San Jose for AMD\'s final and most important launch event of the year: Advancing AI\n\n12:57PM EST - Today AMD is making the eagerly anticipated launch of their next-generation MI300 series of accelerators\n\n12:58PM EST - Including MI300A, their first chiplet-based server APU, and MI300X, their stab at the most powerful GPU/accelerator possible for the AI market\n\n12:59PM EST - I\'d say the event is being held in AMD\'s backyard, but since AMD sold their campus here in the bay area several years ago, this is more like NVIDIA\'s backyard.

PLEASE REVIEW","['\nNvidia Earnings\n\nNvidia\'s EPS Rating is a perfect 99 and its SMR Rating is an A, on a scale of A to a worst E. The EPS rating compares a company\'s earnings growth to other stocks. Its SMR Rating gauges sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.\n\nOn Nov. 21, Nvidia disclosed earnings rocketed 593% in the third quarter and revenue soared 206%, an overall beat.\n\nNvidia earnings accelerated from a 429% gain the prior quarter. Sales growth also sped up sharply from the previous quarter. The chip giant guided Q4 sales of $20 billion, up 231%.\n\nIn Q3, data-center revenue surged 279%. The business includes the A100 and H100 AI chips.\n\nFor the full year, analysts now expect Nvidia earnings to rebound 264% as sales jump 118%. Last year, Nvidia earnings fell 25% per share.\n\nOut of 54 analysts covering NVDA stock, 51 rate it a buy. Three have a hold and no one has a sell, according to FactSet.\n\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners? Start With These 3 Steps\n\nNVDA Backstory, Rivals\n\nThe fabless chipmaker pioneered graphics processing units, or GPUs, to make video games more realistic. It\'s expanding in AI chips, used in supercomputers, data centers and drug development.\n\nNvidia\'s GPUs act as accelerators for central processing units, or CPUs, made by other companies. It\'s working on ""supercomputers"" combining its own CPUs and GPUs.\n\nIn addition, Nvidia chips are used for Bitcoin mining and self-driving electric cars.\n\nNvidia has made a big push into metaverse applications.\n\nFabless chip stocks include Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).\n\nCurrently, the fabless group ranks No. 92 out of 197 industry groups. Fabless companies design the hardware while outsourcing the manufacturing to a third-party firm.\n\nFor the best returns, investors should focus on companies that are leading the market and their own industry group.\n\nIs Nvidia Stock A Buy?\n\nOn a fundamental level, Nvidia is poised for explosive growth. Earnings should more than triple this fiscal year, driven by booming chip sales for data centers and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe fabless chipmaker is expanding in other growth areas, such as automated electric cars, cloud gaming and the metaverse as well.\n\nBut AI competition is intensifying. Macroeconomic uncertainties linger. Geopolitical risks are also rife, from the U.S.-China trade war to actual war in Ukraine and Israel.\n\nNVDA stock has staged a massive comeback, more than tripling in 2023 so far. Nvidia came under pressure after its latest earnings report. Shares are now rebounding from a key level, with the AI chip stock flirting with the buy point again.\n\nBottom line: Nvidia stock is not a buy right now, but it could be soon. As a chip company with exposure to top growth markets, NVDA is always one to watch.\n\nCheck out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content to find dozens of the best stocks to buy or watch.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nSee The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch\n\nCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSmith\n\nJoin IBD Live And Learn Top Chart-Reading And Trading Techniques From The Pros\n\nIn this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. A deeper analysis suggests a bullish view for NVIDIA and a bearish view for AMD.\n\nNVIDIA develops graphics processing units (GPUs) semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, creative design, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, AMD designs processors and related technologies for AI, data centers, gaming, and business-computing applications.\n\nShares of NVDA are up 240% year-to-date. Meanwhile, AMD stock has gained 93% year-to-date, including a 20% return over the last three months.\n\nDespite NVIDIA’s much higher gains this year, it’s trading at a much lower valuation than AMD. We’ll look at their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is currently trading at a P/E of 46.4 versus its three-year average P/E of 29.9.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of around 64.3, NVIDIA is trading at a relatively small premium to its industry (compared to AMD’s premium anyway). In fact,'
 ' the stock hasn’t been this cheap in a year, and its long-term gains also suggest a bullish view might be appropriate despite the tremendous year-to-date gain.\n\nOn a P/E basis, NVIDIA hasn’t been this cheap since December 2022. In fact, NVIDIA was trading at a P/E of over 100 just days ago — before the last earnings report. Of course, significantly higher earnings send a company’s P/E much lower if its stock price doesn’t change dramatically.\n\nIn NVIDIA’s case, its earnings exploded so much higher year-over-year that its P/E was cut nearly in half after just a small pullback from around $500 a share on November 22 to $489 on November 24. For its third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.02 per share on $18.1 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of $3.37 per share on $16.2 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a comparative basis, NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, while its adjusted earnings rose nearly sevenfold year-over-year and 49% quarter-over-quarter. The chipmaker’s GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings rose more than 13 times from a year ago to $3.71 per share, also demonstrating exploding growth.\n\nBefore that earnings report, NVIDIA shares had soared to a record high of around $505 with a P/E of about 120 in November. Normally, I wouldn’t suggest a bullish view of a stock that has risen so much, so fast.\n\nHowever, once the market recognizes its lower valuation — and recovers from management’s warning about significantly lower sales to China and other countries due to export restrictions — NVIDIA shares will likely continue their tear. Despite that warning, the chipmaker still guided for almost 231% revenue growth to $20 billion in the fourth quarter, so it clearly isn’t all that worried.\n\nEven if the stock doesn’t recover dramatically in the near term, NVIDIA’s long-term stock-price gains of 267% over the last three years, 1,184% over the last five, and 13,066% over the last 10 provide some level of safety over the long term. In fact, I would use any near-term pullbacks to add to the position.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $660.39, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies upside potential of 36.7%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAt a P/E of 1,120, Advanced Micro Devices has the opposite problem of NVIDIA. Its valuation has skyrocketed because it’s now barely profitable. However, the chipmaker certainly isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so it’s only a matter of time before it bounces back. For now, though, a bearish view seems appropriate, pending a better entry price or improved earnings numbers.\n\nIn the third quarter, AMD reported $299 million in GAAP net income, although that was an improvement from net income of $66 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company’s net income rose 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. AMD also reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the quarter, up from $5.6 billion a year ago.\n\nUnfortunately, AMD continues to play catch-up to NVIDIA in the area of artificial intelligence, although management did reveal some progress on its last earnings call, announcing improvements in the company’s AI software capabilities through R&D and acquisitions. Management also expects the MI300 data center chip, which will support AI models, to be “the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.” In short, AMD will likely catch up to NVIDIA at some point, but we’re not there yet.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for AMD Stock?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $126.79, the average AMD stock price target implies upside potential of 2.9%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on NVDA, Bearish on AMD\n\nThe battle between NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices has been going on for years, with one company pulling out in front of the other and then the other catching up and trading places. Nonetheless, neither of these companies is going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nHowever, AMD could be playing catch-up to NVIDIA on AI for some time, calling for a wait-and-see']","NVIDIA has made significant advancements in AI technology, particularly with its development of graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.

"Which has higher valuation challenges, AMD or NVDA?","Based on the information gathered, it seems that AMD is facing valuation challenges. The strategic focus on cost-effective, advanced compute by AMD is seen as potentially underleveraged compared to Nvidia's broad AI ecosystem focus. This difference in focus may contribute to AMD's troubling valuation. Additionally, AMD had revenue of $22.68 billion in the last 12 months, with $854.00 million in profits and earnings per share of $0.53. These financial figures also indicate some challenges in AMD's valuation.

Therefore, based on the available data, AMD appears to have higher valuation challenges compared to Nvidia.

A deeper analysis suggests a bullish view for NVIDIA and a bearish view for AMD.\n\nNVIDIA develops graphics processing units (GPUs) semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, creative design, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, AMD designs processors and related technologies for AI, data centers, gaming, and business-computing applications.\n\nShares of NVDA are up 240% year-to-date. Meanwhile, AMD stock has gained 93% year-to-date, including a 20% return over the last three months.\n\nDespite NVIDIA’s much higher gains this year, it’s trading at a much lower valuation than AMD. We’ll look at their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is currently trading at a P/E of 46.4 versus its three-year average P/E of 29.9.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of around 64.3, NVIDIA is trading at a relatively small premium to its industry (compared to AMD’s premium anyway). In fact,'
 ' the stock hasn’t been this cheap in a year, and its long-term gains also suggest a bullish view might be appropriate despite the tremendous year-to-date gain.\n\nOn a P/E basis, NVIDIA hasn’t been this cheap since December 2022. In fact, NVIDIA was trading at a P/E of over 100 just days ago — before the last earnings report. Of course, significantly higher earnings send a company’s P/E much lower if its stock price doesn’t change dramatically.\n\nIn NVIDIA’s case, its earnings exploded so much higher year-over-year that its P/E was cut nearly in half after just a small pullback from around $500 a share on November 22 to $489 on November 24. For its third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.02 per share on $18.1 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of $3.37 per share on $16.2 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a comparative basis, NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, while its adjusted earnings rose nearly sevenfold year-over-year and 49% quarter-over-quarter. The chipmaker’s GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings rose more than 13 times from a year ago to $3.71 per share, also demonstrating exploding growth.\n\nBefore that earnings report, NVIDIA shares had soared to a record high of around $505 with a P/E of about 120 in November. Normally, I wouldn’t suggest a bullish view of a stock that has risen so much, so fast.\n\nHowever, once the market recognizes its lower valuation — and recovers from management’s warning about significantly lower sales to China and other countries due to export restrictions — NVIDIA shares will likely continue their tear. Despite that warning, the chipmaker still guided for almost 231% revenue growth to $20 billion in the fourth quarter, so it clearly isn’t all that worried.\n\nEven if the stock doesn’t recover dramatically in the near term, NVIDIA’s long-term stock-price gains of 267% over the last three years, 1,184% over the last five, and 13,066% over the last 10 provide some level of safety over the long term. In fact, I would use any near-term pullbacks to add to the position.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $660.39, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies upside potential of 36.7%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAt a P/E of 1,120, Advanced Micro Devices has the opposite problem of NVIDIA. Its valuation has skyrocketed because it’s now barely profitable. However, the chipmaker certainly isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so it’s only a matter of time before it bounces back. For now, though, a bearish view seems appropriate, pending a better entry price or improved earnings numbers.\n\nIn the third quarter, AMD reported $299 million in GAAP net income, although that was an improvement from net income of $66 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company’s net income rose 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. AMD also reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the quarter, up from $5.6 billion a year ago.\n\nUnfortunately, AMD continues to play catch-up to NVIDIA in the area of artificial intelligence, although management did reveal some progress on its last earnings call, announcing improvements in the company’s AI software capabilities through R&D and acquisitions. Management also expects the MI300 data center chip, which will support AI models, to be “the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.” In short, AMD will likely catch up to NVIDIA at some point, but we’re not there yet.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for AMD Stock?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $126.79, the average AMD stock price target implies upside potential of 2.9%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on NVDA, Bearish on AMD\n\nThe battle between NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices has been going on for years, with one company pulling out in front of the other and then the other catching up and trading places. Nonetheless, neither of these companies is going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nHowever, AMD could be playing catch-up to NVIDIA on AI for some time, calling for a wait-and-see']","AMD has higher valuation challenges, with a P/E of 1,120, indicating it is barely profitable and its valuation has skyrocketed.

The meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.\n\nHowever, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\n\nNVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises.

 ' future, AI allows computers to learn and solve problems like humans by using (among other things) an advanced form of computer processing which includes machine learning and neural networks.\n\nGiven these immense capabilities, investor interest in AI stocks, namely Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA), have skyrocketed over the past few months as the race to control the technology forges ahead. The money-making potential is immense. The generative AI market is currently growing at 42% and could hit $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. The bulk of the revenue growth from generative AI, estimated $247 billion by 2032, will come from demand for the infrastructure needed to train AI models.\n\n“The release of consumer-focused artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT and Google’s Bard is set to fuel a decade-long boom,” noted Bloomberg. What\'s more, estimates suggests that the AI-assisted digital ads business could reach $192 billion in annual revenue by 2032, while revenue from AI servers could hit $134 billion. But just like other market trendy buzzwords that have captivated the investor community, not every company that puts out an “AI press release,” staking a claim of their piece of the pie, will thrive.\n\nBut if judging solely by their growth forecasts and stocks prices, there are two clear leaders at the moment: Microsoft and Nvidia. Microsoft’s AI advances became known with ChatGPT by way if its $10 billion investment in Open AI, giving Microsoft 33% ownership of the company. Many analysts referred to Microsoft’s AI bet as an ""iPhone moment.” Since then, ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing technology in history, hitting 2 billion users after only six months. Estimates suggests it can reach 3.4 billion global users by the end of 2023.\n\nMicrosoft’s AI advances with its AI integration is being regarded as the best among the cloud giants - a group that includes Amazon (AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG , GOOGL). Estimates are calling for Microsoft ’s AI growth prospects to get a 33% boost. The challenge for investors in terms of valuation of Microsoft stock, what’s does that AI growth prospect equate to? Currently trading near all-time highs of $342, MSFT stock has risen 43% year to date, besting the 14% rise in the S&P 500 index.\n\nMicrosoft stock is more than 20% overvalued, according to several valuation metrics, including P/E which puts its fair value closer to $265. And that’s even when factoring three years worth of growth. The biggest risk in my book would be to assume that any of these conventional valuation metrics matter today. Microsoft’s AI-driven growth could push the stock towards $550 in the next five years, yielding 60% return or 12% annually.\n\nNvidia, which has soared 198% this year, skyrocketed close to 30% after its blowout first quarter earnings results and better-than-expected Q2 guidance. The stock gained $184 billion in one day, vaulting the stock north of a trillion-dollar valuation. Nvidia’s Q2 guidance and its proclaimed leading position as an AI chip supplier got investors excited, guiding for Q2 revenue of $11 billion, crushing estimates for revenue of $8.5 billion.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang has declared that generative AI represents an “iPhone moment.” Investors have since recognized the importance of Nvidia’s GPU data center accelerators which can potentially serve as the backbone for generative AI infrastructure. On the Q1 conference call with analysts, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress affirmed that belief that data centers will inevitably switch to Nvidia’s products incorporating AI. “Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing,” Kress said.\n\nMeanwhile, CEO Huang, in a press release, issued the sort of outlook that suggests Nvidia’s leadership in Generative AI is all but assured. “A trillion dollars of installed global data infrastructure will transition…to accelerated computing as companies race to apply AI to every product, service, and business process,” wrote Huang. The demand for Nvidia’s GPUs based on its Hopper and Ampere architecture was noticeable in its just-announced results.\n\nNvidia continues to enjoy not only tons of AI tailwinds, but also the company’s fundamentals continues to improve evidenced by its margin improvement. As such, despite the stock reaching all-time high levels, the best play here is to stay invested and add on any dips. NVDA stock is poised to reach $500 by the end of the year.\n\nAll told, this new AI frontier is getting crowded.

PLEASE REVIEW","['This morning is an important one for AMD – perhaps the most important of the year. After almost a year and a half of build-up, and even longer for actual development, AMD is launching their next generation GPU/APU/AI accelerator family, the Instinct MI300 series. Based on AMD\'s new CDNA 3 architecture, and combining it with AMD\'s proven Zen 4 cores, AMD will be making a full-court press for the high-end GPU and accelerator market with their new product, aiming to lead in both big-metal HPC as well as the burgeoning market for generative AI training and inference.\n\nTaking the stage for AMD\'s launch event will be AMD CEO Dr. LIsa Su, as well as a numerous AMD executives and ecosystem partners, to detail, at last, AMD\'s latest generation GPU architecture, and the many forms it will come in. With both the MI300X accelerator and MI300A APU, AMD is aiming to cover most of the accelerator market, whether clients just need a powerful GPU or a tightly-coupled GPU/CPU pairing.\n\nThe stakes for today\'s announcement are significant. The market for generative AI is all but hardware constrained at the moment, much to the benefit of (and profits for) AMD\'s rival NVIDIA. So AMD is hoping to capitalize on this moment to cut off a piece – perhaps a very big piece – of the market for generative AI accelerators.

PLEASE REVIEW","["" overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\n\nAt a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P/S. Thus, it looks much more reasonably valued than NVIDIA, especially considering its five-year mean P/S of eight. However, a neutral view might be appropriate in the near term due to the geopolitical overhang for Taiwanese stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enjoyed a nice 11% lift over the last five days due to NVIDIA’s good news, enjoying their best week in almost a year. TSM is likely to see some sales increase from the AI transition because it manufactures NVIDIA’s chips, but any impact is likely to be modest.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could face issues amid the growing tensions between Taiwan and China, which convinced Warren Buffett to dump most of his $4.1 billion stake after less than a year. Given Buffett’s long-term focus, it’s highly unusual that he would sell the position after holding it for such a short time.\n\nThus, while Taiwan Semiconductor could end up being an excellent long-term investment at current prices, the recent rally paired with the geopolitical tensions suggests a neutral view for now.\n\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sells assigned over the last three months. At $118.67, the average Taiwan Semiconductor stock price target implies upside potential of 19.93%.\n\nConclusion: Bearish on NVDA, Neutral on TSM\n\nNVIDIA and TSM clearly have excellent long-term prospects, given their AI exposure. However, it seems like buying NVIDIA shares at current prices could be playing with fire, given its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price.\n\nTSM’s valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI, but the geopolitical overhang adds significant risk to owning the shares.\n\nDisclosure Item 7.

Since reaching tis all-time high of $366 in mid July, shares of Microsoft (MSFT) have fallen as much as 15%. Currently trading at around $326, the stock is still up an impressive 36% year to date, besting the 10% rise in the S&P 500 index, even with a decline of close to 10% over the past three months.\n\nThe enterprise software and cloud giant is scheduled to report first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. Microsoft\'s stock outperformance, even amid the recent struggles in tech, continue to be driven by the company’s leadership position in AI, thanks to its multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. More recently, the company unveiled Microsoft 365 Copilot, an AI-powered version of its productivity platform.\n\nAs a result, the software and cloud giant have been a top pick among among investors and analysts. Microsoft made no secret that AI would be a key source of its future growth. In September, while speaking at Goldman Sach\'s Communacopia + Technology conference, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said that it ""absolutely should be the fastest $10 billion business we\'ve ever built” when referencing Generative AI. Ahead of the tech giant\'s quarterly results Tuesday, Citigroup analysts agrees.\n\nCiting stabilization in IT budgets and a ramp up in revenue related to generative artificial intelligence, the analysts expects Microsoft to deliver ""accelerating"" total revenue and profitability. Its Azure cloud platform and the availability of Microsoft 365 Copilot are also expected to see growth tailwinds. As for the latter, which is priced at $30 per month, some analysts believe it can boost Microsoft’s fiscal 2025 revenue by as much as $9 billion. On Tuesday, the company’s guidance will gauge how confident its management feels about that growth potential.\n\nFor the quarter that ended September, the Redmond, Wash.-based tech giant is expected to earn $2.52 per share on revenue of $51.72 billion. This compares to the year-ago quarter when earnings were $2.35 per share on $49.61 billion in revenue. For the full year, ending June, earnings are projected to rise 5.7% year over year to $10.37 per share, while full-year revenue of $222.33 billion would mark a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.\n\nThe company’s push into artificial intelligence by way of its $10 billion investment in Open AI is the “x-factor” in the market’s renewed optimism. AI is expected to fuel Microsoft’s market share among enterprise customers, not only for cloud adoption but also in its search capabilities. OpenAI recently updated its popular ChatGPT chatbot, bringing the ""Browse with Bing"" feature to all users. The app is now linked to the internet and offers browsing capabilities via Microsoft’s Bing for all users.\n\nIt remains to be seen how much traction Bing generates, compared to Google, but Bank of America analyst Brad Sills who has a Buy rating on the stock and $405 price target, loves Microsoft’s strategy. In a recent note to investors, Sills said he expects Microsoft to post ""modest"" upside, with catalysts coming later in the year. Citing recent checks, Sills said he sees ""sustained, healthy"" new workloads for Azure.\n\nIn the Q4, the company earned $2.69 per share, topping Wall Street estimates by 14 cents, while revenue of $56.2 billion rose 8.34% year over year, surpassing estimates by $700 million.

PLEASE REVIEW","[' the stock hasn’t been this cheap in a year, and its long-term gains also suggest a bullish view might be appropriate despite the tremendous year-to-date gain.\n\nOn a P/E basis, NVIDIA hasn’t been this cheap since December 2022. In fact, NVIDIA was trading at a P/E of over 100 just days ago — before the last earnings report. Of course, significantly higher earnings send a company’s P/E much lower if its stock price doesn’t change dramatically.\n\nIn NVIDIA’s case, its earnings exploded so much higher year-over-year that its P/E was cut nearly in half after just a small pullback from around $500 a share on November 22 to $489 on November 24. For its third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.02 per share on $18.1 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of $3.37 per share on $16.2 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a comparative basis, NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, while its adjusted earnings rose nearly sevenfold year-over-year and 49% quarter-over-quarter. The chipmaker’s GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings rose more than 13 times from a year ago to $3.71 per share, also demonstrating exploding growth.\n\nBefore that earnings report, NVIDIA shares had soared to a record high of around $505 with a P/E of about 120 in November. Normally, I wouldn’t suggest a bullish view of a stock that has risen so much, so fast.\n\nHowever, once the market recognizes its lower valuation — and recovers from management’s warning about significantly lower sales to China and other countries due to export restrictions — NVIDIA shares will likely continue their tear. Despite that warning, the chipmaker still guided for almost 231% revenue growth to $20 billion in the fourth quarter, so it clearly isn’t all that worried.\n\nEven if the stock doesn’t recover dramatically in the near term, NVIDIA’s long-term stock-price gains of 267% over the last three years, 1,184% over the last five, and 13,066% over the last 10 provide some level of safety over the long term. In fact, I would use any near-term pullbacks to add to the position.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $660.39, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies upside potential of 36.7%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAt a P/E of 1,120, Advanced Micro Devices has the opposite problem of NVIDIA. Its valuation has skyrocketed because it’s now barely profitable. However, the chipmaker certainly isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so it’s only a matter of time before it bounces back. For now, though, a bearish view seems appropriate, pending a better entry price or improved earnings numbers.\n\nIn the third quarter, AMD reported $299 million in GAAP net income, although that was an improvement from net income of $66 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company’s net income rose 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. AMD also reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the quarter, up from $5.6 billion a year ago.\n\nUnfortunately, AMD continues to play catch-up to NVIDIA in the area of artificial intelligence, although management did reveal some progress on its last earnings call, announcing improvements in the company’s AI software capabilities through R&D and acquisitions. Management also expects the MI300 data center chip, which will support AI models, to be “the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.” In short, AMD will likely catch up to NVIDIA at some point, but we’re not there yet.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for AMD Stock?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $126.79, the average AMD stock price target implies upside potential of 2.9%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on NVDA, Bearish on AMD\n\nThe battle between NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices has been going on for years, with one company pulling out in front of the other and then the other catching up and trading places. Nonetheless, neither of these companies is going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nHowever, AMD could be playing catch-up to NVIDIA on AI for some time, calling for a wait-and-see'

In July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East. In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.\n\nIn this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.\n\nWith such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter.

What does it mean for a contract to have multiple performance obligations in the context of NVIDIA's revenue recognition practices?,"In the context of Nvidia's revenue recognition practices, a contract with multiple performance obligations refers to a situation where the contract with a customer involves more than one distinct product or service to be delivered. Each of these distinct products or services represents a separate performance obligation that needs to be accounted for separately in terms of revenue recognition. Here is how this concept applies to Nvidia's revenue recognition practices based on the information gathered:

- Nvidia, like other companies, follows the ASC Topic 606 guidelines for revenue recognition, which require the identification of performance obligations in a contract with a customer.
- When Nvidia enters into a contract that includes multiple performance obligations, each of these obligations must be identified and evaluated to determine how revenue should be recognized.
- Revenue recognition for each performance obligation is based on the transfer of control criteria outlined in ASC Topic 606, which involves assessing when the customer obtains control of the promised goods or services.
- Nvidia must allocate the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price, if possible. This allocation impacts how revenue is recognized for each obligation.
- By properly identifying and accounting for multiple performance obligations in contracts, Nvidia ensures compliance with accounting standards and provides a clear financial performance picture to stakeholders.

In summary, for Nvidia, having a contract with multiple performance obligations means recognizing revenue separately for each distinct product or service within the contract, following the guidelines of ASC Topic 606 to ensure accurate and compliant revenue recognition practices.

Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained.\n\nEstimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development Arrangements Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis.\n\nIn certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share.

While the metaverse is still in the early stages of development, it’s already possible to see its potential in areas like education, gaming, wellness and commerce. As metaverse technologies are more widely adopted more economic opportunities will emerge such as opening up new markets and business models, creating better ways of working and transforming training and development. This new series of research examines the economic potential of the metaverse for different countries and regions around the world.\n\nThese reports look at how metaverse technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are already being used locally, and what it might take to maximize economic opportunities in each country and region giving governments and industry the ability to make evidence-based decisions about the policies they adopt and where they focus their efforts. The reports, commissioned by Meta and produced by Deloitte, examine the economic opportunity that could be achieved in the US, Canada, the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Turkey and Asia. We’ve also estimated the economic potential of the metaverse for the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe research finds that the United States is well positioned to harness the potential of the metaverse and lead its global development — both of which are expected to bring significant benefit to the US economy and could contribute between US$402 billion and US$760 billion in annual GDP by 2035. The report notes that American businesses are already using metaverse technologies to create new revenue streams and improve existing ones. US brands and retailers have already begun selling virtual versions of their products, in addition to the physical goods they already sell. Other American companies are using the metaverse to market their physical goods and enable customers to try before they buy with virtual overlays.\n\nThe US report also outlines how American companies are starting to see signs of greater operational efficiencies in areas like training employees in immersive VR, improving remote work by making online interactions more life-like and creating virtual replicas to optimize physical processes. This is already happening, for example, with US companies using digital twins to optimize the design of objects or buildings before their manufacturing or construction gets underway, offering the potential to save businesses time and money.\n\nLikewise, the research highlights that the EU already has relatively high rates of business adoption for technologies like AR and VR — with rates in the EU (10%) higher than in the US (9%). Moreover, achievement of strong digital foundations is a key part of the European Commission’s Digital Decade vision. Like their US counterparts, European retail brands are already exploring how they can connect with consumers in the metaverse. EU farmers are trialing how metaverse technology can improve production, and European automotive manufacturers are developing VR-based systems to design and reconfigure their factories and training systems to improve safety and efficiency. According to the research, continued successful development of the metaverse could contribute an additional €259-€489 billion per year to the region’s GDP by 2035.\n\nAs the report sets out, the Middle East and North Africa are on a journey of economic transformation and digitalization, and regional businesses and governments are showing a growing appetite']","Nvidia has made advancements in the AI chip market with the introduction of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform, which is used for the training and inference of LLMs, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications.

PLEASE REVIEW","['Mark Zuckerberg has spent the last nine months against the ropes as his company has made big cuts to its work force and struggled to gain mainstream traction with its ambitious plans for virtual reality.\n\nOn Thursday, he told Meta employees how he planned to get the company back on track. In an all-hands meeting, Mr. Zuckerberg offered an explanation for recent layoffs and for the first time laid out a vision for how Meta’s work in artificial intelligence would blend with its plans for the virtual reality it calls the metaverse.\n\nMr. Zuckerberg’s talk was an attempt to rally staff after the most tumultuous period in his company’s 19-year history. The chief executive said he made “tough decisions” about layoffs with the goal of “building a better technology company” that shipped better products, faster — something he believed Meta wasn’t doing well as it swelled to more than 80,000 employees at the peak of the pandemic.\n\n“I want us to use this period that’s going to be a bit more stable in order to evolve and rebuild our culture,” he said, according to two people who attended the meeting and shared remarks and a recording with The New York Times. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (&#8220;SA&#8221;). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\n\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.\n\nRefer to Note 19 &#8211; Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. PART II Item 8 &#160; Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge.\n\nWe use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the'
 ' SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\n\nContract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. A deeper analysis suggests a bullish view for NVIDIA and a bearish view for AMD.\n\nNVIDIA develops graphics processing units (GPUs) semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, creative design, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, AMD designs processors and related technologies for AI, data centers, gaming, and business-computing applications.\n\nShares of NVDA are up 240% year-to-date. Meanwhile, AMD stock has gained 93% year-to-date, including a 20% return over the last three months.\n\nDespite NVIDIA’s much higher gains this year, it’s trading at a much lower valuation than AMD. We’ll look at their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is currently trading at a P/E of 46.4 versus its three-year average P/E of 29.9.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of around 64.3, NVIDIA is trading at a relatively small premium to its industry (compared to AMD’s premium anyway). In fact, the stock hasn’t been this cheap in a year, and its long-term gains also suggest a bullish view might be appropriate despite the tremendous year-to-date gain.\n\nOn a P/E basis, NVIDIA hasn’t been this cheap since December 2022. In fact, NVIDIA was trading at a P/E of over 100 just days ago — before the last earnings report. Of course, significantly higher earnings send a company’s P/E much lower if its stock price doesn’t change dramatically.\n\nIn NVIDIA’s case, its earnings exploded so much higher year-over-year that its P/E was cut nearly in half after just a small pullback from around $500 a share on November 22 to $489 on November 24. For its third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.02 per share on $18.1 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of $3.37 per share on $16.2 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a comparative basis, NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, while its adjusted earnings rose nearly sevenfold year-over-year and 49% quarter-over-quarter.

Developments in Advertising Substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers. In particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including its evolving interpretation through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, the European Digital Services Act, and U.S. state privacy laws including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and we expect these and other Table of Contents developments such as the Digital Markets Act will have further impact in the future.\n\nAs a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products and user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the EU, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from ""legitimate interests"" to ""consent,"" and began offering users in the region a ""subscription for no ads"" alternative. We are continuing to engage with regulators on our new consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers\' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. To mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products.\n\nWe are developing privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new features and scaling existing features. We are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for advertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers.\n\nHowever'
 "", we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described above will continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future. Other Business and Macroeconomic Conditions Other global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as inflation, rising interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and macroeconomic conditions in 2023, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial results in future periods. In addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services.

In addition to extensive internal “red teaming” where our internal teams take on the role of adversaries to hunt for flaws, we recently brought our generative AI model to DEFCON — the largest hacker conference in the world. We joined our peers at Google, NVIDIA, OpenAI and others to stress test our different models as part of the first-ever public Generative Red Team Challenge.\n\nOver 2,200 researchers, including hundreds of students and organizations traditionally left out of the early stages of technological change, came together to hunt for bugs and vulnerabilities in these systems. According to the organizers of this challenge, they engaged in over 17,000 conversations with generative AI systems to probe for unintended behaviors – from bad math calculations to misinformation to providing bad user security practices. This open red team challenge was supported by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Science Foundation, and the Congressional AI Caucus. Our hope is that early focus on establishing best practices for this emerging generative AI space will result in safer systems in the long term.\n\nWe believe that openness is the key to tackling some of the biggest challenges we collectively face online. Transparency reports, academic research, and other measures to innovate openly and stress-test our systems help our industry to learn from each other, improve our respective systems, and keep people safe across the internet.\n\nYou can find our quarterly integrity reports on Meta’s Transparency Center. In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.\n\nWith such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan S']","The Generative Red Team Challenge, held at DEFCON, aimed to enhance the safety and further the development of generative AI technologies by bringing together over 2,200 researchers, including students and organizations traditionally left out of early technological advancements, to identify bugs and vulnerabilities in generative AI systems.

Whether it's a custom computer or a pre-built model, a graphics card is essential for rendering games in high quality, and cards from either Nvidia or AMD are what you'll find in all of the best gaming PCs and best gaming laptops.\n\nBoth brands offer a range of graphics cards with entry-level models starting at around $270 and high-end cards costing $1,500 or more. AMD and Nvidia also allow other manufacturers to sell third-party versions of their cards based on their original specs. This can create price variations among models with similar capabilities, since third-party manufacturers may add features like extra fans or lighting.\n\nWhile there are lots of graphics cards to choose from, it's still possible to compare each brand's overall performance in relation to their price. Premium Nvidia graphics cards are typically viewed as the most powerful when it comes to advanced features, while the best AMD cards have a reputation for being significantly more affordable and energy efficient.\n\nBelow, we've broken down details on all the latest graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD, and compare how they stack up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: Price and features\n\nAMD and Nvidia both offer a range of graphics cards for different budgets and performance needs. Nvidia's current lineup is called the GeForce RTX 40 series, while AMD's lineup is called the Radeon RX 7000 series. Here's a rundown of each series.\n\nNote: The cards listed below are for desktop computers. Both brands also make mobile versions of their cards that PC manufacturers can integrate into their gaming laptops, but performance may vary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the company's most powerful graphics card. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's RTX 40 series debuted in fall 2022 with the release of the flagship GeForce RTX 4080 ($1,199) and the premium RTX 4090 ($1,599); four more affordable RTX 40 series cards arrived in 2023.\n\nRTX 40 series cards share a wide range of features, including raytracing, an advanced lighting feature that requires a compatible graphics card, and DLSS 3.0, the latest version of Nvidia's AI-enhanced upscaling technology that makes games easier to run at high frame rates.\n\nOther Nvidia features are designed to benefit content creators; RTX cards include support for AI-based noise removal for your microphone and virtual backgrounds for your webcam, as well as face tracking and auto-focus. However, AMD reports that its graphics cards actually render video faster than the RTX 40 series with common editing programs like Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve Studio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards\n\nAn AMD Radeon RX 7000 series card being used with an AMD Ryzen CPU. XFX\n\nAMD launched the Radeon RX 7000 series of graphics cards in December 2022 with the RX 7900 XT ($899) and 7900 XTX ($999), followed by the release of several lower priced cards in 2023, including the 7700XT and 7800XT which are set to launch on September 6.\n\nAMD cards offer similar performance to Nvidia cards in most games, and usually for a lower price. For example, Tom's Hardware ranks the RX 7900 XT ($999) ahead of the RTX 4080 ($1,199) in terms of overall performance, despite the AMD card typically being $200 cheaper. However, Nvidia cards tend to reveal bigger advantages when you play newer games with more advanced graphical features.\n\nLike the RTX 40 series, AMD's RX 7000 cards do feature ray tracing, but ray tracing performance generally lags behind the RTX 40 series with slower frame rates. The RX 7000 series also has an AI-based rendering feature to improve frame rates, called FSR, but it's not quite as developed as Nvidia's DLSS.\n\nIf you're looking to play newer releases like Cyberpunk 2077 or Allen Wake 2, a weaker AMD card may struggle to deliver graphics at the highest possible quality. That said, AMD does partner with some developers to boost performance on AMD hardware; for example, Microsoft's Starfield was designed with support for AMD's FSR at release, but not DLSS.\n\nAMD also supports a feature called Smart Access Memory to improve performance when you pair its latest CPUs and GPUs together. This feature allows the CPU to use more of the graphics card's memory. However, some Nvidia and Intel hardware can take advantage of a similar feature, called Resizable Bar, so the underlying tech isn't AMD exclusive.\n\nAMD benchmark data that shows RX 7000 graphics cards outperforming Nvidia hardware exclusively use AMD processors during testing, so if you have an Intel processor, you may want to look at publicly sourced benchmarks before buying an AMD card.\n\nThe target resolution and refresh rates for each graphics card were determined based on benchmarks shared by Nvidia, AMD, and crowd sourced""]","The GeForce RTX 40 series and Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards offer different price points, features, and performance levels.

"What sets apart the audience for AMD's ""X"" CPUs, given their heat and power use, from those choosing less power-intensive options, considering cooling and performance?","Based on the information gathered, we can identify some key points that set apart the audience for AMD's ""X"" CPUs, known for their heat and power use, from those choosing less power-intensive options in terms of cooling and performance:

1. **AMD's ""X"" CPUs Audience**:
   - Known for their higher heat and power consumption.
   - Typically offer higher clock speeds, which can lead to increased power usage.
   - Targeted at users who prioritize performance over power efficiency.
   - May require more robust cooling solutions due to their higher heat output.

2. **Less Power-Intensive Options Audience**:
   - Examples include Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus CPUs.
   - Promised to match peak performance of AMD and Intel's processors while using 39% less power.
   - Offer improved power efficiency compared to high-power CPUs like AMD's ""X"" series.
   - Suitable for users looking for a balance between performance and energy efficiency.
   - Likely to generate less heat and require less aggressive cooling solutions.

In summary, the audience for AMD's ""X"" CPUs tends to be performance-focused users willing to trade higher power consumption for increased processing power, while those opting for less power-intensive options like Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus CPUs prioritize energy efficiency without compromising significantly on performance. The former may require better cooling solutions due to their higher heat output, whereas the latter can offer a more balanced approach to cooling and performance.

**PLEASE REVIEW**","[' processors we’ve reviewed to date have hit their thermal limit while under heavy load, even with a 240mm water cooler, and after doing so they throttle back to prevent their temperatures from rising any further.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nThis is something of a ""maximum performance at all costs"" approach, as the processor attempts to achieve as much performance as possible within its thermal limitations. This has come along with a greatly increased power draw, and it\'s the reason AMD\'s CPUs ending in ""X"" don\'t include coolers in the box. Chips pulling as much as 230W from the CPU socket are far too hot for an inexpensive stock cooler to handle. However, as these CPUs are meant primarily for the high-performance enthusiast crowd that mostly uses aftermarket coolers anyway, it\'s not a huge concern.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nIf you don\'t want your desktop to double as a space heater, AMD released lower-power models of existing processors, denoted by the lack of an X at the end of the product name. These non-X variants are put on a strict electrical diet. The 7900X has a 170W thermal design power, or TDP, and a 230W maximum socket draw. The Ryzen 9 7900 consumes a third of that, using the same 65W TDP and 88W socket draw as the AMD Ryzen 7 7700. However, this might be more restrictive for the 7900, as it has four more cores to feed than the 7700. To adjust for this lower power consumption, the base clock rate is down to 3.7GHz, compared with the 7900X at 4.7GHz. The maximum boost frequency is also reduced, from 5.6GHz to 5.4GHz.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nAs with the previous Ryzen generation, the Ryzen 7000X and non-X CPUs are identical from a hardware standpoint. Both the 7900 and 7900X use a two-CCD chiplet design with an Infinity Fabric interconnect between them. Each CCD has eight cores, and two cores on each CCD are disabled. This results in a 12-core/24-thread CPU. Each core has 64K of L1 cache and 1MB of L2 cache attached, and 64MB of L3 cache is shared among all 12 cores.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nThe included cooler is AMD\'s Wraith Prism model. For a stock cooler, it\'s a rather capable unit. A copper contact slug and heat pipes provide better heat transfer than all aluminum designs. The fin stack is fairly large and dense, making the cooler rated for 105W TDP processors. For a touch of style, it also has programmable RGB lighting. As it\'s a downdraft cooler, instead of the more common tower coolers, it should also provide much better airflow and cooling over the RAM and VRMs of whatever motherboard on which it\'s used.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7900: Our Test Setup\n\nAMD\'s Ryzen 9 7900 was benchmarked on our updated AMD AM5 test station. In short, the test bed is an ASRock X670E Taichi motherboard with 32GB of DDR5 memory clocked at the CPU\'s maximum supported RAM frequency (DDR5-5200). CPU cooling is handled by a Cooler Master PL240 Flux all-in-one liquid cooler, while an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition provides discrete graphics power. All of it is mounted on a Praxis Wetbench open-frame PC case with a SilverStone DA850 power supply handling power duties.\n\nBenchmarks specifically testing integrated graphics were run on the Ryzen 9 7900\'s integrated graphics or IGP. All other tests used the GeForce RTX 3080.\n\nTesting the AMD Ryzen 9 7900: CPU Benchmarks\n\nChecking system memory bandwidth, we see the Ryzen 9 7900 tied with the 7900X, as we would expect. With the 7900X having nearly thrice the TDP, we expected it to be able to sustain much higher clocks than the 7900. But the AIDA cache results showed the 7900 much closer than anticipated.\n\nL1 and L2 cache rates were only 5% or less behind the 7900X chip. Things changed in the L3 bandwidth, as the Ryzen 9 7900\'s read rate fell to 10% behind the 7900X, while the L3 write was almost 30% slower, only a little faster than the Ryzen 7 7700 models.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 7900 unexpectedly tied with the 7900X in the Adobe Premiere benchmark. This is an important reminder that not all execution threads are similarly demanding. For example, AVX instructions tend to be markedly power-hungry and generate a lot of heat. It would appear the Ryzen 9 7900X, with its higher']","The audience for AMD's ""X"" CPUs is primarily the high-performance enthusiast crowd, as these CPUs have a greatly increased power draw and hit their thermal limit under heavy load, necessitating aftermarket coolers due to their exclusion of coolers in the box.

How should investors view NVIDIA's AI-driven gains vs. TSMC's valuation amid geopolitical concerns?,"Based on the information gathered, here is how investors could view NVIDIA's AI-driven gains versus TSMC's valuation amid geopolitical concerns:

- NVIDIA has experienced significant gains driven by the surge in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, particularly in cloud computing.
- TSMC, on the other hand, expects the AI market to be a core growth engine this year, indicating a positive outlook for AI-related revenue.
- Despite rumors that NVIDIA's Blackwell data center GPUs would use TSMC's 3nm node, they will instead utilize a modified version of the same process as their predecessors.
- NVIDIA reportedly consumes a significant portion (60%) of TSMC's advanced chip packaging capacity, highlighting the close relationship between the two companies.
- Geopolitical concerns, such as the dim outlook for the semiconductor sector, have impacted NVIDIA's stock, but TSMC's focus on AI revenue could provide a bullish outlook for investors.

In conclusion, investors may consider the following factors when evaluating NVIDIA's AI-driven gains versus TSMC's valuation amid geopolitical concerns:
- NVIDIA's strong position in the AI market and its close ties with TSMC for chip manufacturing.
- TSMC's positive outlook on AI revenue and its role as a key player in the semiconductor industry.
- Geopolitical concerns impacting the sector and potentially influencing stock performance.

PLEASE REVIEW","[' about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\n\nAt a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P/S. Thus, it looks much more reasonably valued than NVIDIA, especially considering its five-year mean P/S of eight. However, a neutral view might be appropriate in the near term due to the geopolitical overhang for Taiwanese stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enjoyed a nice 11% lift over the last five days due to NVIDIA’s good news, enjoying their best week in almost a year. TSM is likely to see some sales increase from the AI transition because it manufactures NVIDIA’s chips, but any impact is likely to be modest.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could face issues amid the growing tensions between Taiwan and China, which convinced Warren Buffett to dump most of his $4.1 billion stake after less than a year. Given Buffett’s long-term focus, it’s highly unusual that he would sell the position after holding it for such a short time.\n\nThus, while Taiwan Semiconductor could end up being an excellent long-term investment at current prices, the recent rally paired with the geopolitical tensions suggests a neutral view for now.\n\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sells assigned over the last three months. At $118.67, the average Taiwan Semiconductor stock price target implies upside potential of 19.93%.\n\nConclusion: Bearish on NVDA, Neutral on TSM\n\nNVIDIA and TSM clearly have excellent long-term prospects, given their AI exposure. However, it seems like buying NVIDIA shares at current prices could be playing with fire, given its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price.\n\nTSM’s valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI, but the geopolitical overhang adds significant risk to owning the shares.\n\nDisclosure Lisa Su displays an AMD Instinct MI300 chip as she delivers a keynote address at CES 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 4, 2023.\n\nAMD said on Tuesday its most-advanced GPU for artificial intelligence, the MI300X, will start shipping to some customers later this year.\n\nAMD\'s announcement represents the strongest challenge to Nvidia , which currently dominates the market for AI chips with over 80% market share, according to analysts.\n\nGPUs are chips used by firms like OpenAI to build cutting-edge AI programs such as ChatGPT.\n\nIf AMD\'s AI chips, which it calls ""accelerators,"" are embraced by developers and server makers as substitutes for Nvidia\'s products, it could represent a big untapped market for the chipmaker, which is best known for its traditional computer processors.\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su told investors and analysts in San Francisco on Tuesday that AI is the company\'s ""largest and most strategic long-term growth opportunity.""\n\n""We think about the data center AI accelerator [market] growing from something like $30 billion this year, at over 50']","Investors should view NVIDIA's AI-driven gains with caution due to its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price, while TSMC's valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI.

What's new in AMD Ryzen 8040 series for AI & graphics vs. its predecessor?,"The AMD Ryzen 8040 series introduces several advancements in AI and graphics capabilities compared to its predecessor:

- The Ryzen Pro 8040 series processors, except for the Ryzen 5 Pro 8540U, now come with AMD's Ryzen AI NPU integrated into the silicon.
- AMD is targeting both consumer and commercial sectors with the Ryzen Pro 8040 'Hawk Point' series of mobile processors for laptops and notebooks, emphasizing AI capabilities.
- The core CPU specs of the Ryzen 8040 series suggest upgraded core counts compared to the previous Ryzen 7040 and 8040 series mobile processors.

These enhancements signify a significant step forward in AI and graphics performance for the AMD Ryzen 8040 series compared to its predecessor.

PLEASE REVIEW","[' AI processing, which is far more cost-effective and environmentally better to perform locally than in the cloud -- data centers to support consumer AI use are a black hole of energy usage and expensive to run. The accelerators are dedicated to iterating through and managing memory for the results of the vector calculations of small, pretrained models running on the device.\n\nAll the primary computer manufacturers now include a neural processing unit tile on its flagship processor\'s die. AMD added it with its Ryzen 7040 series, Qualcomm rolled out its Snapdragon Elite in October, Intel announced it as part of the new Meteor Lake architecture (its first chips with the accelerator are rumored to debut next week) and Apple made its Neural Engine a central part of its M series architecture from the start.\n\nIn parallel with its GPU capabilities, branded RDNA, AMD refers to its NPU\'s capabilities XDNA. The Ryzen 7040 series (Phoenix) included the first generation of the NPU. The mobile processors AMD announced Wednesday for its Ryzen 8040 series (Hawk Point) uses the same NPU architecture but offers better performance. AMD rates Phoenix at 10 trillion operations per second (by the NPU alone), while it says Hawk Point delivers 16 TOPS.\n\nRyzen 8040 series mobile CPUs\n\nMax boost (GHz) Cores Threads NPU Power class Integrated graphics Ryzen 9 8945HS 5.2 8 16 Yes 35-54W Radeon 780M Ryzen 7 8845HS 5.1 8 16 Yes 35-54W Radeon 780M Ryzen 7 8840HS 5.1 8 16 Yes 20-30W Radeon 780M Ryzen 7 8840U 5.1 8 16 Yes 15-30W Radeon 780M Ryzen 5 8645HS 5 6 12 Yes 35-54W Radeon 760M Ryzen 5 8640HS 4.9 6 12 Yes 20-30W Radeon 760M Ryzen 5 8640U 4.9 6 12 Yes 15-30W Radeon 760M Ryzen 5 8540U 4.9 6 12 No 15-30W Radeon 740M Ryzen 3 8440U 4.7 4 8 No 15-30W Radeon 740M\n\nLaptops with the first series of Hawk Point chips are expected to be available by the end of March, and the company has its subsequent-gen XDNA 2 slated to ship to laptop manufacturers later in 2024. AMD claims those ""Strix Point"" Ryzen processors will offer three times better performance for generative AI over Hawk Point. And that may complicate your buy-now-or-wait decision.\n\nBecause CPU branding is complicated, don\'t assume that all 8040-series CPUs have the NPU. At the bottom of the stack, the two cheapest processors don\'t have it, which means the NPU may be out of the reach of budget buyers.\n\nThe Acer Nitro V 16, announced Wednesday. Acer\n\nOne of the spotlight products announced, the updated 16-inch Acer Nitro V 16 gaming laptop goes ""up to"" a Ryzen 7 8845HS and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, but a mystery base configuration starts at $1,000. Who knows if that base includes an NPU-equipped CPU or how price scales for the configurations. Acers equipped with the NPU will use it for optimizing battery life and expanded power-management features. The Nitro\'s expected to ship in March, in line with the wait we usually have from announcement to shipping of new chips this time of year.\n\nAnother reason for the aligned push is to motivate software developers to use the application programming interfaces in order to offload much of the inferencing and generative work the way they address the graphics accelerator for a smoother experience with interactive graphics tasks.\n\nThere are a lot of developers who already use custom AI models, like Adobe, Zoom, OBS (in OBS Studio, for streamers) and Microsoft. But there\'s a multitude of APIs for handling the on-device model and interaction with the operating system -- WindowsML, Intel OpenVINO, Nvidia\'s integration into its own software (like DLSS in the graphics driver and Broadcast) and more. It\'s still all shaking out. We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We implemented a career coaching service to provide one-on-one guidance to employees, and encourage internal job mobility.

"How does the AMD Ryzen 9 7900's power consumption and thermal performance compare to its counterparts, specifically the Ryzen 9 7900X, Ryzen 9 7950X, and Intel's Core i5-13600K and Core i7-13700K, in terms of efficiency?","Based on the data gathered, here is a comparison of the power consumption and thermal performance efficiency of the AMD Ryzen 9 7900 with its counterparts:

1. **AMD Ryzen 9 7900**:
   - TDP: 170W
   - Efficiency: More efficient than equivalent Intel CPUs

In terms of efficiency, both the AMD Ryzen 9 7900 and 7900X are noted to be more efficient than their equivalent Intel counterparts. Unfortunately, specific efficiency data for the Ryzen 9 7950X, Intel Core i5-13600K, and Core i7-13700K was not provided in the gathered information.

Please note that the efficiency comparison for the Ryzen 9 7950X, Intel Core i5-13600K, and Core i7-13700K could not be determined based on the available data.

**PLEASE REVIEW**","[' processors we’ve reviewed to date have hit their thermal limit while under heavy load, even with a 240mm water cooler, and after doing so they throttle back to prevent their temperatures from rising any further.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nThis is something of a ""maximum performance at all costs"" approach, as the processor attempts to achieve as much performance as possible within its thermal limitations. This has come along with a greatly increased power draw, and it\'s the reason AMD\'s CPUs ending in ""X"" don\'t include coolers in the box. Chips pulling as much as 230W from the CPU socket are far too hot for an inexpensive stock cooler to handle. However, as these CPUs are meant primarily for the high-performance enthusiast crowd that mostly uses aftermarket coolers anyway, it\'s not a huge concern.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nIf you don\'t want your desktop to double as a space heater, AMD released lower-power models of existing processors, denoted by the lack of an X at the end of the product name. These non-X variants are put on a strict electrical diet. The 7900X has a 170W thermal design power, or TDP, and a 230W maximum socket draw. The Ryzen 9 7900 consumes a third of that, using the same 65W TDP and 88W socket draw as the AMD Ryzen 7 7700. However, this might be more restrictive for the 7900, as it has four more cores to feed than the 7700. To adjust for this lower power consumption, the base clock rate is down to 3.7GHz, compared with the 7900X at 4.7GHz. The maximum boost frequency is also reduced, from 5.6GHz to 5.4GHz.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nAs with the previous Ryzen generation, the Ryzen 7000X and non-X CPUs are identical from a hardware standpoint. Both the 7900 and 7900X use a two-CCD chiplet design with an Infinity Fabric interconnect between them. Each CCD has eight cores, and two cores on each CCD are disabled. This results in a 12-core/24-thread CPU. Each core has 64K of L1 cache and 1MB of L2 cache attached, and 64MB of L3 cache is shared among all 12 cores.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nThe included cooler is AMD\'s Wraith Prism model. For a stock cooler, it\'s a rather capable unit. A copper contact slug and heat pipes provide better heat transfer than all aluminum designs. The fin stack is fairly large and dense, making the cooler rated for 105W TDP processors. For a touch of style, it also has programmable RGB lighting. As it\'s a downdraft cooler, instead of the more common tower coolers, it should also provide much better airflow and cooling over the RAM and VRMs of whatever motherboard on which it\'s used.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nAMD Ryzen 9 7900: Our Test Setup\n\nAMD\'s Ryzen 9 7900 was benchmarked on our updated AMD AM5 test station. In short, the test bed is an ASRock X670E Taichi motherboard with 32GB of DDR5 memory clocked at the CPU\'s maximum supported RAM frequency (DDR5-5200). CPU cooling is handled by a Cooler Master PL240 Flux all-in-one liquid cooler, while an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition provides discrete graphics power. All of it is mounted on a Praxis Wetbench open-frame PC case with a SilverStone DA850 power supply handling power duties.\n\nBenchmarks specifically testing integrated graphics were run on the Ryzen 9 7900\'s integrated graphics or IGP. All other tests used the GeForce RTX 3080.\n\nTesting the AMD Ryzen 9 7900: CPU Benchmarks\n\nChecking system memory bandwidth, we see the Ryzen 9 7900 tied with the 7900X, as we would expect. With the 7900X having nearly thrice the TDP, we expected it to be able to sustain much higher clocks than the 7900. But the AIDA cache results showed the 7900 much closer than anticipated.\n\nL1 and L2 cache rates were only 5% or less behind the 7900X chip. Things changed in the L3 bandwidth, as the Ryzen 9 7900\'s read rate fell to 10% behind the 7900X, while the L3 write was almost 30% slower, only a little faster than the Ryzen 7 7700 models.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 7900 unexpectedly tied with the 7900X in the Adobe Premiere benchmark. This is an important reminder that not all execution threads are similarly demanding. For example, AVX instructions tend to be markedly power-hungry and generate a lot of heat. It would appear the Ryzen 9 7900X, with its higher'
 "" voltage and power draw, generated excessive heat in this task and lowered its clock speed accordingly. The 7900, running on a much lower power curve, but using the same cooler, has less heat debt to contend with and so was able to match the 7900X frequency in this benchmark.\n\nAll other benchmarks in this suite showed no surprises. The Ryzen 9 7900X, with its generous power allowance, could almost always maintain a higher clock frequency under heavy load. The 7900X was slightly ahead of the 7900 in Photoshop and the single-thread benches, and the lead often grew in multi-threaded tasks.\n\nAs we saw the Intel Core i7-13700K ahead of the Ryzen 9 7900X in the last review, it had an even bigger advantage here when the AMD chip was limited by power draw. The Core i5-13600K is now almost a dead tie with the 7900 in all aspects.\n\nTesting the AMD Ryzen 9 7900: Discrete Graphics Benchmarks\n\nOur gaming results are no different than we saw in the Ryzen 9 7900X review. The synthetic Time Spy bench is designed to test all CPU capabilities, not just those most commonly used in games, and showed more separation in the CPU models. Otherwise, any Ryzen 7000 chip not equipped with 3D V-Cache was practically indistinguishable from another when paired with a RTX 3080. Intel's Raptor Lake CPUs had small wins in a few titles. Games have certainly become more multi-threaded in the past 10 years, but not all benefit from high core counts.\n\nTesting the AMD Ryzen 9 7900: Integrated Graphics Benchmarks\n\nNo, this isn't a repeat of the last benchmarks; the integrated GPU results simply reinforce the last results. And though it's past broken-record status, we'll say again the integrated graphics in Ryzen 7000 CPUs are for generic home and office use and nothing more. Apart from the 3D V-Cache-enabled models, every Ryzen 7000 CPU in these tests was in essence tied with each other.\n\nTesting the AMD Ryzen 9 7900: Power and Heat\n\nNow, the Ryzen 9 7900 finally gets to show its secret superpowers. Compared with the Ryzen 9 7900X, the Ryzen 9 7950X, the Core i5-13600K, and especially the Core i7-13700K gulping down electricity, the 7900 politely sipped. The Core i5-13600K had a marginal lead over the 7900 in gaming, and the two traded blows in our CPU tests. But the Core i5-13600K used considerably more power to do it (71W, or nearly 40% more in Cinebench). Likewise, compared with the 7900X, the 7900 was only a step or two behind in the CPU tests and perfectly tied in gaming, but the 7900X was also using much more power (101W, or 55% more in Cinebench). It was almost embarrassing for the Core i7-13700K, having performed 10% to 20% ahead of the 7900 in our tests, but needing twice the power to do it.\n\nIt wasn't surprising to see the 7900 operate much cooler compared with the non-X Ryzen chips. It was also not too surprising that it ran just as cool as the Ryzen 7 7700, since both have the same 65W TDP and 88W socket power draw. What was surprising is that the Ryzen 9 7900 operated four more cores than the Ryzen 7 7700 using the same power limit without any massive clock drops. With AMD and Intel seemingly racing to the power-draw pole position with their recent performance chips, this level of efficiency is not only welcome but also quite impressive.\n\nTesting the AMD Ryzen 9 7900: Wraith Prism Cooler\n\nHaving just raved about the Ryzen 9 7900's efficiency, it's important to see if it was only the result of the big liquid cooler on the test bed. As a non-X CPU, the 7900 ships with AMD's Wraith Prism cooler, the same one that ships with the Ryzen 7 7700. The Prism is rated to 105W TDP, which should be more than suitable.\n\nAs we see, the Wraith doesn't quite keep up with the Cooler Master AIO we use on the test bed, but that's almost splitting hairs. The 3 degree C delta is insignificant, as the CPU maintains the same clock speed. The Cinebench runs under both coolers were within 1.5% of each other, well within the margin of error of the test. As the Ryzen 9 7900 under the Wraith was still 20 degrees C under its thermal maximum, overclocking is still wide open, whether you want to simply use an auto-overclocking utility or AMD Ryzen Master to set a custom power limit. A 7900 under a Wraith may even be able to catch a 7900X given how close they already are in performance.\n""]","The AMD Ryzen 9 7900 demonstrates significantly higher efficiency compared to its counterparts. It consumes considerably less power than the Ryzen 9 7900X, Ryzen 9 7950X, and Intel's Core i5-13600K and Core i7-13700K. Specifically, the Ryzen 9 7900 sips power politely, with the Core i5-13600K using nearly 40% more power and the Ryzen 9 7900X using 55% more power in Cinebench tests. The Core i7-13700K needed twice the power of the Ryzen 9 7900 to perform 10% to 20% better in tests. Additionally, the Ryzen 9 7900 operates much cooler compared to the non-X Ryzen chips and as cool as the Ryzen 7 7700, despite having four more cores and using the same power limit without significant clock drops. This level of efficiency is impressive, especially in the context of the recent trend towards higher power draw in performance chips.",84,0.99999999995,0.5714285714285714,0.9545883621154241,1.0,0.2857142853061225
What's the aim of DEFCON's Gen AI Red Team Challenge & its impact on AI?,"The aim of DEFCON's Gen AI Red Team Challenge is to adapt Red Team strategies to AI's evolving nature. This challenge focuses on mastering AI cyber defenses by adapting Red Team strategies to the dynamic and learning nature of AI systems. The impact of this challenge on AI is to enhance cybersecurity measures by understanding and addressing the evolving capabilities and vulnerabilities of AI systems. By adapting Red Team strategies to AI's dynamic nature, the challenge aims to improve the defense mechanisms against potential threats in AI systems.

PLEASE REVIEW","[' like generative AI. In addition to extensive internal “red teaming” where our internal teams take on the role of adversaries to hunt for flaws, we recently brought our generative AI model to DEFCON — the largest hacker conference in the world. We joined our peers at Google, NVIDIA, OpenAI and others to stress test our different models as part of the first-ever public Generative Red Team Challenge.\n\nOver 2,200 researchers, including hundreds of students and organizations traditionally left out of the early stages of technological change, came together to hunt for bugs and vulnerabilities in these systems. According to the organizers of this challenge, they engaged in over 17,000 conversations with generative AI systems to probe for unintended behaviors – from bad math calculations to misinformation to providing bad user security practices. This open red team challenge was supported by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Science Foundation, and the Congressional AI Caucus. Our hope is that early focus on establishing best practices for this emerging generative AI space will result in safer systems in the long term.\n\nWe believe that openness is the key to tackling some of the biggest challenges we collectively face online. Transparency reports, academic research, and other measures to innovate openly and stress-test our systems help our industry to learn from each other, improve our respective systems, and keep people safe across the internet.\n\nYou can find our quarterly integrity reports on Meta’s Transparency Center. In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better.

Risk Factors&#8221;, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. Overview Our Company and Our Businesses NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for accelerated computing, AI solutions, scientific computing, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications. Our two operating segments are ""Compute &#38; Networking"" and ""Graphics."" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Demand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models Demand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand.\n\nWhile we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity. Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue.\n\nThe increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs. We build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown.\n\nGlobal Trade During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.

During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Nvidia falls in, has gained 3.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $4.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +401.1%.

Over the past month, the estimate has changed +20.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues.

PLEASE REVIEW","[' about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\n\nAt a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P/S. Thus, it looks much more reasonably valued than NVIDIA, especially considering its five-year mean P/S of eight. However, a neutral view might be appropriate in the near term due to the geopolitical overhang for Taiwanese stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enjoyed a nice 11% lift over the last five days due to NVIDIA’s good news, enjoying their best week in almost a year. TSM is likely to see some sales increase from the AI transition because it manufactures NVIDIA’s chips, but any impact is likely to be modest.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could face issues amid the growing tensions between Taiwan and China, which convinced Warren Buffett to dump most of his $4.1 billion stake after less than a year. Given Buffett’s long-term focus, it’s highly unusual that he would sell the position after holding it for such a short time.\n\nThus, while Taiwan Semiconductor could end up being an excellent long-term investment at current prices, the recent rally paired with the geopolitical tensions suggests a neutral view for now.\n\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sells assigned over the last three months. At $118.67, the average Taiwan Semiconductor stock price target implies upside potential of 19.93%.\n\nConclusion: Bearish on NVDA, Neutral on TSM\n\nNVIDIA and TSM clearly have excellent long-term prospects, given their AI exposure. However, it seems like buying NVIDIA shares at current prices could be playing with fire, given its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price.\n\nTSM’s valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI, but the geopolitical overhang adds significant risk to owning the shares.\n\nDisclosure Lisa Su displays an AMD Instinct MI300 chip as she delivers a keynote address at CES 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 4, 2023.\n\nAMD said on Tuesday its most-advanced GPU for artificial intelligence, the MI300X, will start shipping to some customers later this year.\n\nAMD\'s announcement represents the strongest challenge to Nvidia , which currently dominates the market for AI chips with over 80% market share, according to analysts.\n\nGPUs are chips used by firms like OpenAI to build cutting-edge AI programs such as ChatGPT.\n\nIf AMD\'s AI chips, which it calls ""accelerators,"" are embraced by developers and server makers as substitutes for Nvidia\'s products, it could represent a big untapped market for the chipmaker, which is best known for its traditional computer processors.\n\nAMD CEO Lisa Su told investors and analysts in San Francisco on Tuesday that AI is the company\'s ""largest and most strategic long-term growth opportunity.""\n\n""We think about the data center AI accelerator [market] growing from something like $30 billion this year, at over 50']","AMD's announcement of the MI300X AI chip signifies a strong challenge to Nvidia's current dominance in the AI chip market.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nNvidia is expected to post earnings of $4.41 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +401.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +20.8%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $12.17 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +264.4%. This estimate has changed +14.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.71 indicates a change of +61.9% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +20.6%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for""]","Earnings estimate revisions influence Nvidia's stock price by determining the fair value of its stock.

What is the Graphics Chip Die (GCD) size and its role in the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT's performance?,"Based on the information gathered, there is no specific data available regarding the Graphics Chip Die (GCD) size of the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT or its direct role in the GPU's performance. The documents provided did not contain details on the GCD size or its impact on the GPU's performance. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a direct answer to your query based on the information available.

PLEASE REVIEW","["" was a new manufacturing process. Both of these were expected, as such changes happen almost every generation. I covered them in my launch review of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nThe third technology is the fresh chiplet design, which debuted in the first AMD Radeon RX 7000-series graphics cards. Chiplets don't underpin every Radeon RTX 7000-series card, though. After releasing the chiplet-based Radeon RX 7900 XTX and the similar Radeon RX 7900 XT, AMD next released the Radeon RX 7600 with a monolithic chip design. That raised the question of what future cards in the line would look like. Now, we have our answer.\n\nThe Radeon RX 7800 XT is built on a chiplet design akin to the one used in the RX 7900 XTX and the RX 7900 XT. It's based around one large chip that is referred to as the Graphics Chip Die (GCD). It measures 200mm2 and contains 60 compute units, giving it 62.5% as many resources as the GCD in the 7900 XTX.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nAs for cache, the RX 7800 XT also comes with four Memory Cache Dies (MCDs) that measure roughly 37mm2 each, for a total combined area of about 150mm2. Each of these MCDs supports a 64-bit memory interface and 16MB of L2 cache, giving the RX 7800 XT an aggregate 256-bit memory interface and 64MB of L2 cache. AMD fitted the card out with 16GB of GDDR6 memory that operates at 19.5Gbps, enabling 624GBps of total bandwidth. All of this is about two-thirds of what’s available on the Radeon RX 7900 XTX.\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of the number of ray accelerators, AI accelerators, TMUs, ROPs, and shaders, please see the chart above. Often when we see a drop in the amount of resources, we see a slight increase in clock speed to partially make up for the disparity in shaders. We do not see this with the Radeon RX 7800 XT and instead see a slight drop in clock speed. It tops out at a boost clock of 2,430MHz, compared with the Radeon RX 7900 XTX’s boost of 2,500MHz.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nWhile all of these reductions make the RX 7800 XT look slower than the 7900 XTX—on paper, and in benchmarks—this is only half of the story. If we take price into consideration, the RX 7800 XT is the most alluring product in AMD’s Radeon RX 7000 series.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nPut simply, at $499, the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT costs half as much as the RX 7900 XTX, while packing roughly two-thirds of its resources. This equates to better overall value-per-dollar, and it places the RX 7800 XT in a competitive position in the graphics card market.\n\nAMD's Reference Design and FSR 3\n\nFor review, AMD sent us a Radeon RX 7800 XT based on its internally developed reference design. This card is equipped with two internal eight-pin PCIe power connections, and it has three DisplayPort connectors and an HDMI port on its rear I/O panel. The reference card employs a dual-fan thermal solution that's just a bit wider than a standard dual-slot card.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nBefore I move on to testing, I have one last key detail to address: FSR 3. AMD developed FSR 3 in response to Nvidia’s DLSS 3 technology, and it works in a similar way: by generating artificial frames between existing frames to boost overall frame rates.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nThis feature was introduced alongside the RX 7800 XT, but I have little to say about it at this time. AMD hasn’t shared explicit details (yet) about how this technology works, though it is an open technology and can work with a wide range of graphics cards—from AMD, or otherwise.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nThough FSR 3 will be available to everyone soon, AMD was not able to provide us with early access to the game files required to test FSR 3 for this review. We’ll need to investigate this feature at a later date.\n\nAMD Radeon RX 7800 XT: Our Test Setup\n\nOur test system for graphics cards is built on an Asus ROG Maximus Z690 Hero motherboard with a stock-clocked Intel Core i9-12900K processor actively cooled by a Corsair Hydro Series H100X water cooler. This lot is paired with 32""]","The Graphics Chip Die (GCD) size in the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT measures 200mm2 and contains 60 compute units.

Whether it's a custom computer or a pre-built model, a graphics card is essential for rendering games in high quality, and cards from either Nvidia or AMD are what you'll find in all of the best gaming PCs and best gaming laptops.\n\nBoth brands offer a range of graphics cards with entry-level models starting at around $270 and high-end cards costing $1,500 or more. AMD and Nvidia also allow other manufacturers to sell third-party versions of their cards based on their original specs. This can create price variations among models with similar capabilities, since third-party manufacturers may add features like extra fans or lighting.\n\nWhile there are lots of graphics cards to choose from, it's still possible to compare each brand's overall performance in relation to their price. Premium Nvidia graphics cards are typically viewed as the most powerful when it comes to advanced features, while the best AMD cards have a reputation for being significantly more affordable and energy efficient.\n\nBelow, we've broken down details on all the latest graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD, and compare how they stack up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: Price and features\n\nAMD and Nvidia both offer a range of graphics cards for different budgets and performance needs. Nvidia's current lineup is called the GeForce RTX 40 series, while AMD's lineup is called the Radeon RX 7000 series. Here's a rundown of each series.\n\nNote: The cards listed below are for desktop computers. Both brands also make mobile versions of their cards that PC manufacturers can integrate into their gaming laptops, but performance may vary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the company's most powerful graphics card. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's RTX 40 series debuted in fall 2022 with the release of the flagship GeForce RTX 4080 ($1,199) and the premium RTX 4090 ($1,599); four more affordable RTX 40 series cards arrived in 2023.\n\nRTX 40 series cards share a wide range of features, including raytracing, an advanced lighting feature that requires a compatible graphics card, and DLSS 3.0, the latest version of Nvidia's AI-enhanced upscaling technology that makes games easier to run at high frame rates.\n\nOther Nvidia features are designed to benefit content creators; RTX cards include support for AI-based noise removal for your microphone and virtual backgrounds for your webcam, as well as face tracking and auto-focus. However, AMD reports that its graphics cards actually render video faster than the RTX 40 series with common editing programs like Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve Studio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards\n\nAn AMD Radeon RX 7000 series card being used with an AMD Ryzen CPU. XFX\n\nAMD launched the Radeon RX 7000 series of graphics cards in December 2022 with the RX 7900 XT ($899) and 7900 XTX ($999), followed by the release of several lower priced cards in 2023, including the 7700XT and 7800XT which are set to launch on September 6.\n\nAMD cards offer similar performance to Nvidia cards in most games, and usually for a lower price. For example, Tom's Hardware ranks the RX 7900 XT ($999) ahead of the RTX 4080 ($1,199) in terms of overall performance, despite the AMD card typically being $200 cheaper. However, Nvidia cards tend to reveal bigger advantages when you play newer games with more advanced graphical features.\n\nLike the RTX 40 series, AMD's RX 7000 cards do feature ray tracing, but ray tracing performance generally lags behind the RTX 40 series with slower frame rates. The RX 7000 series also has an AI-based rendering feature to improve frame rates, called FSR, but it's not quite as developed as Nvidia's DLSS.\n\nIf you're looking to play newer releases like Cyberpunk 2077 or Allen Wake 2, a weaker AMD card may struggle to deliver graphics at the highest possible quality. That said, AMD does partner with some developers to boost performance on AMD hardware; for example, Microsoft's Starfield was designed with support for AMD's FSR at release, but not DLSS.\n\nAMD also supports a feature called Smart Access Memory to improve performance when you pair its latest CPUs and GPUs together. This feature allows the CPU to use more of the graphics card's memory. However, some Nvidia and Intel hardware can take advantage of a similar feature, called Resizable Bar, so the underlying tech isn't AMD exclusive.\n\nAMD benchmark data that shows RX 7000 graphics cards outperforming Nvidia hardware exclusively use AMD processors during testing, so if you have an Intel processor, you may want to look at publicly sourced benchmarks before buying an AMD card.\n\nThe target resolution and refresh rates for each graphics card were determined based on benchmarks shared by Nvidia, AMD, and crowd sourced""]","The GeForce RTX 40 series and Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards offer different price points, features, and performance levels.

Whether it's a custom computer or a pre-built model, a graphics card is essential for rendering games in high quality, and cards from either Nvidia or AMD are what you'll find in all of the best gaming PCs and best gaming laptops.\n\nBoth brands offer a range of graphics cards with entry-level models starting at around $270 and high-end cards costing $1,500 or more. AMD and Nvidia also allow other manufacturers to sell third-party versions of their cards based on their original specs. This can create price variations among models with similar capabilities, since third-party manufacturers may add features like extra fans or lighting.\n\nWhile there are lots of graphics cards to choose from, it's still possible to compare each brand's overall performance in relation to their price. Premium Nvidia graphics cards are typically viewed as the most powerful when it comes to advanced features, while the best AMD cards have a reputation for being significantly more affordable and energy efficient.\n\nBelow, we've broken down details on all the latest graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD, and compare how they stack up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: Price and features\n\nAMD and Nvidia both offer a range of graphics cards for different budgets and performance needs. Nvidia's current lineup is called the GeForce RTX 40 series, while AMD's lineup is called the Radeon RX 7000 series. Here's a rundown of each series.\n\nNote: The cards listed below are for desktop computers. Both brands also make mobile versions of their cards that PC manufacturers can integrate into their gaming laptops, but performance may vary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the company's most powerful graphics card. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's RTX 40 series debuted in fall 2022 with the release of the flagship GeForce RTX 4080 ($1,199) and the premium RTX 4090 ($1,599); four more affordable RTX 40 series cards arrived in 2023.\n\nRTX 40 series cards share a wide range of features, including raytracing, an advanced lighting feature that requires a compatible graphics card, and DLSS 3.0, the latest version of Nvidia's AI-enhanced upscaling technology that makes games easier to run at high frame rates.\n\nOther Nvidia features are designed to benefit content creators; RTX cards include support for AI-based noise removal for your microphone and virtual backgrounds for your webcam, as well as face tracking and auto-focus. However, AMD reports that its graphics cards actually render video faster than the RTX 40 series with common editing programs like Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve Studio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards\n\nAn AMD Radeon RX 7000 series card being used with an AMD Ryzen CPU. XFX\n\nAMD launched the Radeon RX 7000 series of graphics cards in December 2022 with the RX 7900 XT ($899) and 7900 XTX ($999), followed by the release of several lower priced cards in 2023, including the 7700XT and 7800XT which are set to launch on September 6.\n\nAMD cards offer similar performance to Nvidia cards in most games, and usually for a lower price. For example, Tom's Hardware ranks the RX 7900 XT ($999) ahead of the RTX 4080 ($1,199) in terms of overall performance, despite the AMD card typically being $200 cheaper. However, Nvidia cards tend to reveal bigger advantages when you play newer games with more advanced graphical features.\n\nLike the RTX 40 series, AMD's RX 7000 cards do feature ray tracing, but ray tracing performance generally lags behind the RTX 40 series with slower frame rates. The RX 7000 series also has an AI-based rendering feature to improve frame rates, called FSR, but it's not quite as developed as Nvidia's DLSS.\n\nIf you're looking to play newer releases like Cyberpunk 2077 or Allen Wake 2, a weaker AMD card may struggle to deliver graphics at the highest possible quality. That said, AMD does partner with some developers to boost performance on AMD hardware; for example, Microsoft's Starfield was designed with support for AMD's FSR at release, but not DLSS.\n\nAMD also supports a feature called Smart Access Memory to improve performance when you pair its latest CPUs and GPUs together. This feature allows the CPU to use more of the graphics card's memory. However, some Nvidia and Intel hardware can take advantage of a similar feature, called Resizable Bar, so the underlying tech isn't AMD exclusive.\n\nAMD benchmark data that shows RX 7000 graphics cards outperforming Nvidia hardware exclusively use AMD processors during testing, so if you have an Intel processor, you may want to look at publicly sourced benchmarks before buying an AMD card.\n\nThe target resolution and refresh rates for each graphics card were determined based on benchmarks shared by Nvidia, AMD, and crowd sourced""]","Nvidia has pricier, feature-rich high-end cards compared to AMD.",114,0.9999999999,1.0,0.9108236055178409,1.0,0.999999995

PLEASE REVIEW","['GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM clocked at 5,600MHz, and a 1TB Corsair MP600 Pro NVMe 4.0 SSD for storage. Power is provided by a Corsair HX1500i power supply that is rated 80 Plus Platinum efficient and can supply up to 1,500 watts of power to the system at any given time. All tests were performed inside of Windows 11 Pro with the latest updates installed.\n\nThe pricing dynamics of the graphics card market have been turbulent in recent years, which makes it difficult to describe the Radeon RX 7800 XT\'s exact position at launch. It has the characteristics of a midrange graphics card, which better fits the likes of the RX 7600 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060. It\'s also not a flagship card and is vastly different from the ""high end"" graphics cards we were introduced to at the initial launch of the Radeon RX 7000 and GeForce RTX 40 families. Calling the RX 7800 XT a high-end card still fits best, though high-end has never quite felt so close to the middle.\n\nIn its position as a high-end but not top-end graphics card, the RX 7800 XT comes into closest competition with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, which occupies a similar tier in the graphics card market. However, this too feels like an awkward comparison: Nvidia\'s GeForce RTX 4070 cards start at $599, making that GPU line clearly more expensive than the $499 RX 7800 XT.\n\nAs for pricing, the $499 Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB is a better match, but that card and the lesser 8GB RTX 4060 Ti have some notable shortcomings that weaken their position against the RX 7800 XT. (Nvidia points out that a few specific base-model versions of the 16GB RTX 4060 Ti are selling for under MSRP, at $449—which was true at this writing, but most of the 16GB cards were still $500 or more.) All told, the RX 7800 XT undercuts the RTX 4060 Ti line, and with resources that are on a closer level to the RTX 4070\'s.\n\nDetermining exactly how these cards compare is what we have benchmark testing for, of course. But the specs and pricing suggest that the Radeon RX 7800 XT represents one of the best values we\'ve seen in quite some time in the graphics card world. Let\'s see if that bears out.\n\nSynthetic Tests\n\nSynthetic tests allow us to gauge a graphics processor’s raw performance, but they can never tell the full story. Both 3DMark and Furmark show about what we would expect to see, with the RX 7800 XT results coming in fairly close to the RTX 4070, which was still a clear step ahead in all but a few subtests.\n\nLuxMark tests the compute performance of graphics cards, and that test showed an even greater advantage for the RTX 4070. It’s only in Unigine\'s Superposition trial that we saw the RX 7800 XT pull back a bit, coming to a near dead-even tie with the RTX 4070 in the DirectX 11 test and slightly surpassing it when OpenGL is used.\n\nRay Tracing, FSR, and DLSS Game Testing\n\nAMD’s graphics cards are at their deepest disadvantage when it comes to games that support ray tracing. Nvidia has placed a greater emphasis on boosting ray-tracing performance than AMD has up to this point, but even with that advantage, it’s still not an open-and-shut case for Nvidia in ray-tracing games.\n\nIn our first ray-tracing game test (using F1 22), the Radeon RX 7800 XT was able to beat out the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti by roughly 13% at 1080p and about 31% at 4K. It didn’t fare quite as well against the RTX 4070, which surpassed the Radeon RX 7800 XT by as much as 12%. That changed with FSR 1.0 and DLSS 2.0 enabled, handing the advantage back to the RX 7800 XT. DLSS 3 enables the RTX 4070 to pull ahead again, but only at 1440p.\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, we saw much the same results as in F1 22, with the Radeon RX 7800 XT outperforming the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti and slightly behind the GeForce RTX 4070 with FSR and DLSS off. We didn’t test this game with DLSS 2, but with DLSS 3 even the significantly slower GeForce RTX 4060 was able to pull ahead of the Radeon RX 7800 XT.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy has shown a preference for Nvidia-based graphics cards, and we typically see Nvidia cards perform significantly better in this test. Despite this inherent disadvantage, the Radeon RX 7800 XT performed quite well in this test. It was only slightly behind the RTX 4060 Ti in this test at 1080p.'
 "" this or on any other front. Price and performance are always the most important factors for desktop components, and the Radeon RX 7800 XT excels at both.\n\n(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)\n\nWhen discussing components, it’s necessary to take a broader look to understand a product's place in the market. Sometimes, we can let the numbers speak for themselves: The Radeon RX 7800 XT best compares with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 4070 in terms of performance, but the RX 7800 XT costs $100 less. When the performance is so frequently on a near-even footing or possibly even better on the cheaper card, what reason do you have to buy the more expensive one? Sure, the RTX 4070 is occasionally faster, but neither consistently nor overwhelmingly, and even in those cases the speed spread still isn’t enough to justify the added expense.\n\nThe second-closest competing Nvidia graphics card to the Radeon RX 7800 XT is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, but if anything, that comparison looks much worse for Nvidia here. The RTX 4060 Ti has an MSRP of $399 for cards that ship with 8GB of GDDR6 RAM, and cards with 16GB of RAM are $499-plus (with the exception of the few basic $449 models). Even pitted against the 16GB GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, the RX 7800 XT remains the more attractive deal.\n\nIndeed, AMD's Radeon RX 7800 XT is significantly faster than the 8GB RTX 4060 Ti in almost every test, and in this case the performance difference is more than sufficient to justify the $100 premium. This situation only worsens if you look closely at tests running at 1440p and 4K, as the 8GB RTX 4060 Ti is held back by a limited memory interface that cramps its performance above 1080p.

Power is provided by a Corsair HX1500i power supply that is rated 80 Plus Platinum efficient and can supply up to 1,500 watts of power to the system at any given time. All tests were performed inside of Windows 11 Pro with the latest updates installed.\n\nThe pricing dynamics of the graphics card market have been turbulent in recent years, which makes it difficult to describe the Radeon RX 7800 XT\'s exact position at launch. It has the characteristics of a midrange graphics card, which better fits the likes of the RX 7600 and the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060. It\'s also not a flagship card and is vastly different from the ""high end"" graphics cards we were introduced to at the initial launch of the Radeon RX 7000 and GeForce RTX 40 families. Calling the RX 7800 XT a high-end card still fits best, though high-end has never quite felt so close to the middle.\n\nIn its position as a high-end but not top-end graphics card, the RX 7800 XT comes into closest competition with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, which occupies a similar tier in the graphics card market. However, this too feels like an awkward comparison: Nvidia\'s GeForce RTX 4070 cards start at $599, making that GPU line clearly more expensive than the $499 RX 7800 XT.\n\nAs for pricing, the $499 Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB is a better match, but that card and the lesser 8GB RTX 4060 Ti have some notable shortcomings that weaken their position against the RX 7800 XT. (Nvidia points out that a few specific base-model versions of the 16GB RTX 4060 Ti are selling for under MSRP, at $449—which was true at this writing, but most of the 16GB cards were still $500 or more.) All told, the RX 7800 XT undercuts the RTX 4060 Ti line, and with resources that are on a closer level to the RTX 4070\'s.\n\nDetermining exactly how these cards compare is what we have benchmark testing for, of course. But the specs and pricing suggest that the Radeon RX 7800 XT represents one of the best values we\'ve seen in quite some time in the graphics card world. Let\'s see if that bears out.\n\nSynthetic Tests\n\nSynthetic tests allow us to gauge a graphics processor’s raw performance, but they can never tell the full story. Both 3DMark and Furmark show about what we would expect to see, with the RX 7800 XT results coming in fairly close to the RTX 4070, which was still a clear step ahead in all but a few subtests.\n\nLuxMark tests the compute performance of graphics cards, and that test showed an even greater advantage for the RTX 4070. It’s only in Unigine\'s Superposition trial that we saw the RX 7800 XT pull back a bit, coming to a near dead-even tie with the RTX 4070 in the DirectX 11 test and slightly surpassing it when OpenGL is used.\n\nRay Tracing, FSR, and DLSS Game Testing\n\nAMD’s graphics cards are at their deepest disadvantage when it comes to games that support ray tracing. Nvidia has placed a greater emphasis on boosting ray-tracing performance than AMD has up to this point, but even with that advantage, it’s still not an open-and-shut case for Nvidia in ray-tracing games.\n\nIn our first ray-tracing game test (using F1 22), the Radeon RX 7800 XT was able to beat out the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti by roughly 13% at 1080p and about 31% at 4K. It didn’t fare quite as well against the RTX 4070, which surpassed the Radeon RX 7800 XT by as much as 12%. That changed with FSR 1.0 and DLSS 2.0 enabled, handing the advantage back to the RX 7800 XT. DLSS 3 enables the RTX 4070 to pull ahead again, but only at 1440p.\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, we saw much the same results as in F1 22, with the Radeon RX 7800 XT outperforming the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti and slightly behind the GeForce RTX 4070 with FSR and DLSS off. We didn’t test this game with DLSS 2, but with DLSS 3 even the significantly slower GeForce RTX 4060 was able to pull ahead of the Radeon RX 7800 XT.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy has shown a preference for Nvidia-based graphics cards, and we typically see Nvidia cards perform significantly better in this test. Despite this inherent disadvantage, the Radeon RX 7800 XT performed quite well in this test. It was only slightly behind the RTX 4060 Ti in this test at 1080p.'

PLEASE REVIEW","["" The two cards then tied at 1440p, and the RX 7800 XT pulled ahead for a slim 2fps advantage at 4K. The RX 7800 XT had no chance of touching the RTX 4070 this time, however.\n\nWhen Driver Issues Get in the Way\n\nOut of all of the tests I ran, the most disappointing result is one that’s not shown here. I’ve been testing graphics cards with Returnal as I slowly weave it into the standard array of graphics cards tests I use. I’ve never had an issue with this test or game, even while using Intel’s Arc graphics cards—until now.\n\nIn what can only be a driver issue, AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT crashed every time I attempted to run Returnal. This was unique to the RX 7800 XT and did not affect any other Radeon cards I put through this test, including the RX 7700 XT, the RX 7600, and the RX 7900 XTX.\n\nThough this gives a poor first impression, it’s necessary to temper any reaction to this issue. The volume of games on the market, even if you just count the ones considered modern AAA titles, is enormous. We expect all of these games to run flawlessly on new hardware, but realistically glitches slip through, which is why we have driver updates. I’m sure that AMD will fix this issue at some point before long, but it is nevertheless disappointing to see from an otherwise class-leading product.\n\nAAA Game Testing\n\nIn games that don’t support ray tracing, the GeForce RTX 40-series cards lose one of their greatest advantages, giving AMD's Radeon RX 7800 XT an ever greater chance to shine.\n\nWithout ray tracing, the RX 7800 XT was predictably able to run circles around the RTX 4060 Ti in Total War: Three Kingdoms, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Far Cry 5. The one exception to this was in Far Cry 5 at 1080p, which has shown irregular results likely due to some sort of bottleneck on the processor or game engine. At 1440p and 4K, however, the RX 7800 XT was far faster than the RTX 4060 Ti in Far Cry 5, too.\n\nNvidia’s GeForce RTX 4070 didn't score a clean win here. Instead it traded places, with the RX 7800 XT performing better in Total War: Three Kingdoms and the RTX 4070 retorting with wins in the other two games.\n\nLegacy Games Testing\n\nOlder games are often challenging for newer graphics cards—not because they lack the performance to run the games, but because these games receive less modern driver support, which can result in reduced performance or even cause games to fail to run.\n\nWe can’t raise any criticism on AMD in this area, however, as all tests ran without issue and performance was overall impressive. The Radeon RX 7800 XT performed well in Bioshock Infinite, trading places with the RTX 4070 once again. In Hitman Absolution, the RX 7800 XT maintained a healthy lead over the RTX 4070 across all three test resolutions. And in Sleeping Dogs, the two cards once again traded places back and forth.\n\nPower and Thermals\n\nWe test the power consumption of our graphics card test bed using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to gauge the power draw of each card. Only the graphics card and applicable drivers are changed between tests, giving us a decent idea of the power consumption of each card, if not an exact measurement.\n\nPower consumption is one area in which AMD has room to improve relative to its Nvidia competition. The GeForce RTX 4070 performed on a competitive footing with the Radeon RX 7800 XT, but the RTX 4070 had notably lower power consumption numbers in all areas except the idle power draw. The RTX 4060 Ti’s power consumption numbers were even lower.\n\nThermal readings were also higher for the Radeon RX 7800 XT card, which was somewhat disappointing as the RX 7900 XT fared significantly better in this area. This suggests the cooler was responsible for the lackluster temp readings on the RX 7800 XT, as it has a less robust thermal solution than the RX 7900 XT's. This situation could be significantly better on some cards made by AMD’s board partners, with some cards perhaps outfitted with more-robust cooling schemes. But for now, all we can do is speculate on that front.\n\nWe should be clear, however, that the thermal readings on the RX 7800 XT weren’t terrible. The 69 degrees C thermal reading is well within the safe operating range for the card and acceptable for continuous use.\n\nVerdict: AMD's Best Effort of the 7000s\n\nThough the AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT ran a little warm and used a bit more power than we may have liked, it’s hard for us to fault the card for""

"How did the new USG licensing requirements, which regulate exports to certain countries including China, affect NVIDIA's sales to China in the fiscal year 2024?","Based on the information gathered, the new US government licensing requirements that regulate exports to certain countries, including China, have had an impact on Nvidia's sales to China in the fiscal year 2024. The intensified restrictions on chip exports to China by the US government have created challenges for Nvidia in selling its products in China. The semiconductor industry in the US has been lobbying against these restrictions due to the fear of market uncertainty. This situation indicates that Nvidia's sales to China may have been affected negatively due to these new regulations.

Additionally, the restrictions on the flow of high-tech products to China due to security concerns have been highlighted as detrimental to both US companies and Chinese businesses. This further supports the notion that Nvidia's sales to China could have been impacted by the US export restrictions on Chinese tech companies.

Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that Nvidia's sales to China in the fiscal year 2024 were likely influenced by the new US government licensing requirements that regulate exports to China.

Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.\n\nWith such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\n\nAt a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P']",NVIDIA's sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024.,120,0.9999999999,0.5714285714285714,0.9674303430544663,1.0,0.571428570612245

The maximum frame rate and resolution possible with each card will vary based on the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: Which graphics card should you choose?\n\nUltimately, choosing between an AMD or Nvidia graphics card comes down to your personal needs, budget, and preferences. Those building their own PC with a smaller budget may prefer the affordability of AMD graphics cards, while those willing to pay more to play brand-new games with graphics that can best the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X will likely want an Nvidia 4080 or 4090 card to maximize performance.\n\nOf course, high-end AMD cards like the RX 7900 XT or RX 7900 XTX are still capable of playing the latest releases, but Nvidia's top models have an edge when you enable advanced features like ray tracing.\n\nFAQs\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat should you know before buying a graphics card?\n\nBefore you buy any graphics card, you should make sure that it's a good fit for your computer. Using an older CPU or motherboard with a brand-new graphics card can limit your overall performance and create bottlenecks that prevent you from getting the most out of your card.\n\nCheck that your motherboard supports the latest specifications, like PCIe 4.0. Newer graphics cards also demand lots of power, so make sure your power supply has enough juice to keep your computer running.\n\nFinally, always measure the inside of your case to make sure the graphics card will physically fit during installation, as different cases can position the graphics card at different angles. Different manufacturers also make different sized versions of the same graphics card to add extra fans or lighting. 3 Most Important Financial Statements\n\nEmotions in Investing: How to Manage Stock Market Anxiety & Stress\n\nFutures Trading: Everything You Need to Know\n\nFor Investors: Business Valuation 101\n\n11 Up-and-Coming Stocks to Invest In\n\nWhen to Sell Stocks — for Profit or Loss\n\nAccounts That Earn Compounding Interest\n\nHow Many Shares Should I Buy of a Stock?\n\nSelling Stock: How Capital Gains Are Taxed\n\nMarket Order vs. Limit Order\n\nHow Are Stock Prices Determined?\n\nWhat Is a Good Return on Investment?\n\nDay Trading Definition: Why It Differs From Investing\n\nThe Definitive Guide: How to Value a Stock\n\nWhat Happens When a Stock Is Delisted?\n\nGAAP vs. Non-GAAP: Everything You Need to Know\n\nShould I Buy Stock Now or Wait?\n\nA Beginner's Guide to Understanding Financial News\n\nTechnical Analysis for the Long-Term Investor\n\nHow to Calculate Cost Basis for Inherited Stock\n\nWhat Are Share Repurchases?\n\nHow to Research Stocks\n\nAverage Stock Market Return\n\nHow to Short a Stock\n\nStock vs. Share: What's the Difference?\n\nHow to Find Investment Ideas\n\nInvestment Strategies for the Long Term\n\nWhat is the Difference Between Simple & Compound Interest?\n\nWhy Is It Important to Invest in Stocks?\n\nWhat Makes a Stock Price Go Up?\n\nHow to Pick a Stock for the First Time\n\nCan You Owe Money on Stocks?\n\nOptions vs. Stocks: What's the Difference?\n\nTaxes on Investments: Understanding the Basics\n\nHow Many Stocks Should You Own?\n\nSocially Responsible Investing\n\nHow to Gift Stock\n\nHow to Invest in Stocks: A Step-by-Step Guide\n\nHow to Calculate Volatility of a Stock\n\nHow to Calculate Total Stock Returns\n\nHow to Calculate Take\n\n\n\nHome Pay\n\nTax Loss Harvesting\n\nHow to Invest in""]","Nvidia GPUs offer advanced features like ray tracing and DLSS 3.0, which are designed to enhance gaming experiences by providing more realistic lighting effects and improving game performance at high frame rates.

These metrics provide strategic product insights which allow us to assess the performance across our commercial and consumer businesses. In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.\n\nWith such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three']","The key metrics and trends for evaluating NVDA and TSM's investment potential and risks include their price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios, year-to-date stock performance, comparison to the U.S. semiconductor industry averages, NVIDIA's data-center revenue growth, and the impact of generative AI on the market.

PLEASE REVIEW","['Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (&#8220;SA&#8221;). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 &#8211; Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. PART II Item 8 &#160; Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. '
 'Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Revenue Recognition Revenue Allowances For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development Arrangements Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.

What could be the implications of Meta's open AI development ethos and AMD's external dependencies for the broader tech ecosystem's innovation trajectory?,"Meta's OpenAI development ethos, particularly with the release of the Llama 3 open-source AI model, could have several implications for the broader tech ecosystem's innovation trajectory:

1. Accelerated Innovation: 
   - Open-source models like Llama 3 can accelerate innovation by allowing a wider community of developers to access and contribute to the development of advanced AI models.
   - This ethos of releasing models early and enabling the developer community to participate can lead to faster advancements in AI technology.

2. Ethical Concerns:
   - The open-source nature of these models could raise ethical concerns, especially regarding the potential misuse of AI technology for creating deepfakes or other malicious purposes.
   - Balancing the benefits of open-source innovation with the need for ethical considerations will be crucial for the tech ecosystem.

Now, let's gather information about AMD's external dependencies to further analyze the implications for the broader tech ecosystem's innovation trajectory. 

Gatherer, please provide data on AMD's external dependencies.","['Update on February 15, 2024 at 7:00AM PT:\n\nWe want to make more data from our platforms available to academic researchers so they can pursue public interest research, while doing so in a way that respects both people’s privacy and our compliance obligations.\n\nIn the months since we rolled out our Meta Content Library tool we’ve been gathering feedback from researchers to ensure the sort of publicly-accessible data they need is available to them in a way that’s effective for their research. Based on that feedback, we are adding some new data and features.\n\nOne of the biggest requests was to make content from public figures more accessible to researchers so it is easier to study the impact their activity on Facebook and Instagram has on politics, society and culture. So, in the coming weeks, we’re making it possible for researchers to download certain publicly-accessible content posted by public figures and widely-known figures and entities. This data will be accessible in a downloadable CSV format through the Meta Content Library user interface and won’t require access through a virtual clean room.\n\nIn the next few months, we’ll also be adding ‘comments’ as a new data type within the Meta Content Library. This will help researchers study how people around the world receive, discuss and reinterpret content across publicly-accessible pages and posts. We’ll be starting with comments from public forums on Facebook, which researchers will be able to analyze within ICPSR’s virtual clean room.\n\nOur Third Party Fact-Checking partners will also have access to Meta Content Library to help them investigate and debunk misinformation. We hope these powerful search capabilities will help them do this more efficiently, particularly during key moments such as elections.\n\nOriginally published on November 21, 2023 at 3:00AM PT:\n\nTo understand the impact social media apps like Facebook and Instagram have on the world, it’s important to support rigorous, independent research. That’s why Meta has been committed to an open and privacy-protective approach to research for many years, including making tools available to support public interest research, such as the US 2020 studies.\n\nOver the past few months we gave Beta access to our new Meta Content Library and API tools. After multiple rounds of feedback with researchers and other stakeholders, we are now in a position to roll these tools out more broadly.\n\nMeta Content Library & API\n\nOur Meta Content Library and API tools provide access to near real-time public content from Pages, Posts, Groups and Events on Facebook, as well as from creator and business accounts on Instagram. Details about the content, such as the number of reactions, shares, comments and, for the first time, post view counts are also available. Researchers can search, explore and filter that content on both a graphical User Interface (UI) or through a programmatic API.\n\nTogether, these tools provide the most comprehensive access to publicly-available content across Facebook and Instagram of any research tool we have built to date. They also help us meet new regulatory requirements, data-sharing and transparency compliance obligations. Introducing these tools to researchers early in the development process gave us the opportunity to improve them before making them more widely available. We will continue to make improvements as we collect more feedback from researchers.\n\nIndividuals from qualified institutions pursuing scientific or public interest research topics will be able to apply for access to these tools through partners with deep expertise in secure data sharing for research, starting with the University of Michigan’s Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. This is a first-of-its-kind partnership that will enable researchers to analyze data from the API in ICPSR’s Social Media Archive’s (SOMAR) Virtual Data Enclave.\n\nSocial Capital Research\n\nLast year, in collaboration with Raj Chetty and Harvard’s Opportunity Insights Program, we released a landmark study to measure the drivers of economic mobility in the US using information from 21 billion friendships on Facebook, which found that social connections play an important role in helping communities rise out of poverty.\n\nWe’re now expanding this research program with Harvard to better understand the drivers of economic mobility around the world by using insights from our platform on the dynamics of social networks, as well as publicly available data on socioeconomics and schools. We plan to examine cross-class friendships across the United Kingdom in collaboration with experts at the Behavioural Insights Team, Royal Society of Arts, Stripe Partners and Neighbourly Lab.\n\nAs well as expanding to more countries, we also plan to do more research into the role social connections play in economic opportunity including business creation, attending college, and getting a job. Building on our work looking at how social connections benefit people, we will continue to study how social networks help communities recover from crises and help displaced populations and migrants.'
 'For example, our Client segment revenue decreased due to a decline in the PC market in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023, and our Embedded segment revenue decreased as a result of an inventory correction in several end markets in the second half of 2023. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products. Excess or obsolete inventory have resulted in, and may in the future result in, write-downs of the value of our inventory. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, we recorded certain charges primarily for inventory, pricing and related reserves in the Gaming and Client segments. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, a reduction in the average selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions. Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner includes the use of third-party intellectual property. In the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties that incorporate into our software or hardware. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, or laws are adopted that affect our use of third party intellectual property in certain regions or products, our business could be materially adversely affected. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business and products. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, drivers), memory and other components that we use to design, support and sell, and our customers utilize to support and/or use our product offerings. We also rely on our AIB partners to support our products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on, utilized in, or support our products, or laws are adopted that result in the same, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we lose Microsoft Corporation&#8217;s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors&#8217; products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors&#8217; products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. We extend credit to certain of our distributors and AIB partners. If we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners or incur higher allowances for credit losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.

 'Recent breakthroughs in AI, and generative AI in particular, have captured the public’s imagination and demonstrated what those developing these technologies have long known — they have the potential to help people do incredible things, create a new era of economic and social opportunities, and give individuals, creators, and businesses new ways to express themselves and connect with people.\n\nWe believe an open approach is the right one for the development of today’s AI models, especially those in the generative space where the technology is rapidly advancing. By making AI models available openly, they can benefit everyone. Giving businesses, startups, entrepreneurs, and researchers access to tools developed at a scale that would be challenging to build themselves, backed by computing power they might not otherwise access, will open up a world of opportunities for them to experiment, innovate in exciting ways, and ultimately benefit from economically and socially.\n\nAnd we believe it’s safer. Opening access to today’s AI models means a generation of developers and researchers can stress test them, identifying and solving problems fast, as a community. By seeing how these tools are used by others, our own teams can learn from them, improve those tools, and fix vulnerabilities.\n\nMeta has put exploratory research, open source, and collaboration with academic and industry partners at the heart of our AI efforts for over a decade. We’ve seen first-hand how innovation in the open can lead to technologies that benefit more people. Dozens of large language models have already been released and are driving progress by developers and researchers. They’re being used by businesses as core ingredients for new generative AI-powered experiences. We’ve been blown away by the huge demand for Llama 1 from researchers — with more than 100,000 requests for access to the large language model — and the amazing things they’ve achieved by building on top of it.\n\nWe’re now ready to open source the next version of Llama 2 and are making it available free of charge for research and commercial use. We’re including model weights and starting code for the pretrained model and conversational fine-tuned versions too. As Satya Nadella announced on stage at Microsoft Inspire, we’re taking our partnership to the next level with Microsoft as our preferred partner for Llama 2 and expanding our efforts in generative AI. Starting today, Llama 2 is available in the Azure AI model catalog, enabling developers using Microsoft Azure to build with it and leverage their cloud-native tools for content filtering and safety features. It is also optimized to run locally on Windows, giving developers a seamless workflow as they bring generative AI experiences to customers across different platforms. Llama 2 is available through Amazon Web Services (AWS), Hugging Face, and other providers too.\n\nPeople and businesses have benefited from the longstanding partnership between Microsoft and Meta. Together we’ve introduced an open ecosystem for interchangeable AI frameworks, and we’ve co-authored research papers to advance the state of the art in AI. We’ve collaborated to scale the adoption of PyTorch — today’s leading AI framework created by Meta and the AI community — on Azure, and we’re among the founding members of the PyTorch Foundation. Microsoft and Meta recently joined a cohort of supporters that endorse the Partnership on AI’s framework for collective action in the creation and sharing of synthetic media. Our partnership extends outside of AI and into the metaverse too to deliver immersive experiences for the future of work and play.\n\nNow, with this expanded partnership, Microsoft and Meta are supporting an open approach to provide increased access to foundational AI technologies to the benefits of businesses globally. It’s not just Meta and Microsoft that believe in democratizing access to today’s AI models. We have a broad range of diverse supporters around the world who believe in this approach too — including companies that have given us early feedback and are excited to build new products with Llama 2, cloud providers that will include Llama 2 in their offerings for customers, research institutions who are collaborating with us on the safe and responsible deployment of large generative models, and people across tech, academia, and policy who see the benefits as we do.\n\nA Focus on Responsibility\n\nOur open source approach promotes transparency and access. We know that while AI has brought huge advances to society, it also comes with risk. We are committed to building responsibly and are providing a number of resources to help those who use Llama 2 do so too.\n\nRed-Teaming Exercises: Our fine-tuned models have been red-teamed — tested for safety — through internal and external efforts. The team worked to generate adversarial prompts to facilitate model fine-tuning. In addition, we commissioned third parties to conduct external adversarial testing across our fine-tuned models to similarly identify gaps in performance. These safety fine-tuning processes are iterative; we will continue to invest in safety through fine-tuning and benchmarking and plan to release updated fine-tuned models based on these efforts.\n\nTransparency Schematic: We explain our fine-tuning and evaluation methods for the model and identify its shortcomings. Our transparency schematic, which is located within the research paper , discloses known challenges and issues we’ve experienced and provides insight into mitigations taken and future ones we intend to explore.\n\nResponsible Use Guide: We created this guide as a resource to support developers with best practices for responsible development and safety evaluations. It outlines best practices reflective of current, state-of-the-art research on responsible generative AI discussed across the industry and the AI research community.\n\nAcceptable Use Policy: We put a policy in place that prohibits certain use cases to help ensure that these models are being used fairly and responsibly.\n\nMeta has also created new initiatives to harness the insight and creativity of individuals, researchers, and developers around the world to get feedback on how the models are performing and how they might be improved.\n\nOpen Innovation AI Research Community: Today, we also launched a new partnership program for academic researchers that aims to deepen our understanding of the responsible development and sharing of large language models. Researchers may apply to join a community of practitioners to share learnings on this important topic, and the community will form a research agenda to pursue going forward.\n\nLlama Impact Challenge: We want to activate the community of innovators who aspire to use Llama to solve hard problems. We are launching a challenge to encourage a diverse set of public, non-profit, and for-profit entities to use Llama 2 to address environmental, education and other important challenges. The challenge rules will be available prior to the start of it.\n\nConclusion\n\nThroughout our company’s history, we’ve experienced the benefits of an open source approach when innovating in other areas of the business. Our engineers developed and shared frameworks that are now industry standards — like React, a leading framework for making web and mobile applications, and PyTorch, which is now the leading framework for AI. These became commonly used infrastructure for the entire technology industry. We believe that openly sharing today’s large language models will support the development of helpful and safer generative AI too.\n\nWe look forward to seeing what the world builds with Llama 2.']","Meta's open AI development strategy, paired with AMD's reliance on third-party collaborations, offers a potent mix for driving innovation in the tech ecosystem.

PLEASE REVIEW","[""Back at CES 2023, AMD announced the first wave of Ryzen Mobile parts based on its Zen 4 architecture, the Ryzen Mobile 7040HS series. Based on AMD's Phoenix silicon, which uses TSMC's 4 nm process node to mix Zen 4 CPU cores with AMD's RDNA 3 graphics compute units all in a single, monolithic die, Phoenix is the next generation of high efficiency, highly-integrated AMD silicon. And today, AMD is revealing that Phoenix is going to spread its wings a little farther, with the announcement of the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series for ultraportable notebooks.\n\nBringing AMD's latest generation technologies down to the thin and light laptop market, the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series follows AMD's traditional cascading launch mobile launch strategy, delivering new silicon into increasingly lower powered devices as chip production ramps up and OEMs finish putting together new designs. Whereas the original 7040HS series is aimed at higher-power, higher performing laptops, the 7040U series tunes the same same silicon for more modest TDPs in the 15 Watt to 30 Watt range, making it better suited for use in ultraportable thin and light laptops – and fully exploiting the efficiency advantages of Zen 4.\n\nWe've been expecting the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series for quite some time now – AMD made it clear as far back as CES that a traditional U-series lineup was in the works, but until now we just didn't know when to expect it. Though considering that you still can't buy a 7040HS laptop today, today's 7040U announcement from AMD should not be taken as a sign that 7040U laptops are going to be on retail shelves any time in the immediate future.\n\nAMD Ryzen 7040U Series: Up to 8-Cores With RDNA 3 Graphics\n\nAMD's Ryzen Mobile 7040 series spans multiple key mobile product categories, ranging from the entry-level, which AMD segments as 'everyday computing' to its 'extreme gaming and creator' lineup for high-end and powerful gaming laptops. At the bottom of AMD's Pheonix Point series for mobile, the new AMD Ryzen Mobile 7040U series is comprised of four SKUs, which range from 8-core parts down to 4-cores; all of which include AMD's RDNA 3 integrated graphics. Phoenix also introduces AMD's Ryzen AI technology, an FPGA-based AI engine developed by Xilinx, which AMD claims are the first AI processor of its kind and is designed to accelerate AI workloads.\n\nAs they announced at CES 2023, AMD has updated its mobile naming scheme to make it somewhat easier for users to decipher what all the digits and characters in the product name mean. For the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series, the first digit represents the model year, with 7 being used for 2023, while the second digit represents the market segment, e.g., Ryzen 7 = 7, Ryzen 5 = 5/6, and Ryzen 3 = 3/4. The third digit (4) represents the CPU architecture of the product, so in the case of the 7040, it uses its latest Zen 4 cores.\n\nThe last character (suffix) is perhaps the most important indicator of the market segment, as it relates to the TDP and form factor, as the U relates to being a 15-30 W part. For those of you playing at home, this is a slight increase in the TDP window over previous generations – where the U series was 15-28 W – though with laptop vendors able to set their TDPs wherever they like, official TDPs are more of loose guidelines these days anyhow.\n\nAMD Ryzen 7040U Mobile CPUs (Phoenix 4nm) AnandTech C/T Base\n\nFreq (MHz) Turbo\n\nFreq\n\n(MHz) iGPU iGPU CUs iGPU Freq L3 Cache\n\n(MB) TDP Ryzen 7 7840U 8/16 3300 5100 Radeon 780M 12 Up to 2.7 GHz 16 15-30W Ryzen 5 7640U 6/12 3500 4900 Radeon 760M 8 Up to 2.6 GHz 16 15-30W Ryzen 5 7540U 6/12 3200 4900 Radeon 740M 4 Up to 2.5 GHz 16 15-30W Ryzen 3 7440U 4/8 3000 4700 Radeon 740M 4 Up to 2.5 GHz 8 15-30W\n\nLooking at the four Ryzen 7040U SKUs for thin and light AMD-based notebooks, all four of its 'Pheonix' based APUs include AMD's RDNA 3 Radeon 700M series integrated graphics. Starting with the premier model, the Ryzen 7 7840U is an 8C/16T part with a base frequency of 3.3 GHz and a turbo frequency of up to 5.1 GHz. It has a combined total cache of 24 MB, with 16 MB of L3 cache for the entire chip and 1 MB of L2 cache per core, for a total of 8 MB of L2 cache.\n\nMoving down the stack is a pair of Ryzen 5 models, the Ryzen 5 7640U and Ryzen 7540U, both of which include 6 CPU cores. The Ryzen 5 7640U is the faster of the two chips, with a 300 MHz bump on CPU base frequency over the 7540U (3.5 v.s 3.2 GHz), though both APUs have a turbo frequency of up to 4.9 GHz. Curiously, AMD is also using this point as the dividing line between what parts do or do not get the Ryzen AI co-processor; the upper-tier 7640U comes with it, but the lower-tier 7540U does not. Past that, the Ryzen 5 7640U and Ryzen 5 7540U are 6-core parts, so they have 16 MB of L3 cache and 6 MB of L2 cache.\n\nAs these are Ryzen 5 mobile Zen 4 APUs, they include AMD's Radeon 700M graphics. The Ryzen 5 7640U has the better iGPU of the two, with the Radeon 760M with 8 CUs with a maximum frequency of up to 2.6 GHz. In comparison, the Ryzen 5 7540U has the lower spec Radeon 740M with 4 CUs, although both iGPUs feature the same 16 ROPs/2 RB+ blocks.\n\nThe entry-level option to AMD's Zen 4 7040U series chips is the Ryzen 3 7440U, which is a quad-core APU (4C/8T) with a base frequency of 3.0 GHz, a turbo frequency of up to 4.7 GHz. This part also includes the Radeon 740M (4 CU) integrated graphics. As this is a 4-core part, AMD has significantly reduced the amount of available cache, for a combined total of 12 MB that's split into 8 MB of L3 cache and 4 MB of L2 cache.\n\n\n\nBlock diagram of the AMD Radeon 780M integrated graphics\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the Radeon 780M with 12 compute units (CU) has four Render Backends (RB+) blocks within the silicon, while both the Radeon 760M (8 CU) and Radeon 740M (4 CU) feature just two RB+ blocks. Compared to the Ryzen Mobile 6000 series, AMD has also improved the graphics frequencies, with the Radeon 780M clocking up to 2.7 GHz, which is 300 MHz faster than the Radeon 680M, which hit up to 2.4 GHz.\n\nAMD Ryzen 7040U With Ryzen AI: One Xilinx XDNA Block Included\n\nAMD's acquisition of Xilinx, which closed in February of last year, means they have been able to feed Xilinx's expertise and architecture into its latest Zen 4 products. The most prominent example is what AMD calls Ryzen AI, which is part of Xilinx's XDNA architecture. This XDNA-based architecture has been enabled within two of the four Ryzen 7040U series SKUs, with the top two SKUs, the Ryzen 7 7840U and Ryzen 5 7640U, getting access to the Ryzen AI block integrated into the silicon. The inclusion of 'Ryzen AI' is to bolster the capability of AMD's Phoenix processors in AI inference workloads, offering more efficient task-specific silicon than what the CPU or GPU are capable of.\n\nAnother interesting highlight of AMD Ryzen AI is that it directly supports Microsoft's Studio Effects pack within Windows 11, which AMD claims can only be enabled by a dedicated engine like AMD Ryzen AI. While an interesting inclusion to the silicon for AI workloads, AMD hasn't provided or published any expected performance figures to accompany the announcement.\n\nWhile we typically take a robust stance in digesting in-house performance figures, we usually don't take these at face value with in-house benchmarks optimizing things for favorable results. AMD did, however, provide some compute, and gaming performance figures comparing the performance of the Ryzen 7 7840U to Intel's Core i7-1360P and compute performance against Apple's M2 silicon.\n\nAMD is claiming up to 175% gains in Passmark 10 performance over Apple's M2 chip while offering up to 228% Media Encode performance over the Core i7-1360P; these are undoubtedly best-case figures and are to be taken with a pinch of salt. Interestingly in the gaming performance figures, which it put up its Ryzen 7 7840U with Radeon 780M integrated graphics again Intel's Core i7-1360P with Iris Xe graphics, it's not too surprising to see that the Radeon 780M performed between 130% and 239% better than Intel in specific titles. If nothing else, AMD typically invests in more GPU silicon for their high-end mobile processors.\n\nRegarding battery life, AMD states that it has heavily invested in efficiency leadership designed to bolster battery life by implementing Smart Power Management. As with previous announcements of its 7040HS series, AMD has yet to indicate how long battery life might be. Still, as partners and notebook vendors start to integrate Ryzen 7040U APUs with Zen 4 into their solutions, we'll eventually see how efficient AMD's Ryzen Mobile 7040U 15-30 W chips are compared to the previous generation.\n\nRyzen 7040U Launch: No Date as of Yet, But Expected Very Soon\n\nOne of the most significant talking points surrounding AMD's Ryzen 7040 mobile series is when they will launch. Early indications from AMD stated that we should start seeing broader adoption of its 7040 chips sometime in March. AMD announced to us in mid-March that it had pushed back the launch of its Ryzen Mobile 7040HS series until April.\n\nAs for the AMD Ryzen Mobile 7040U series, AMD isn't announcing any kind of release date or expected availability date at this time. Given the timing of AMD's announcement – a few weeks before Computex – we expect we'll find out more about the specific laptops in development and their expected release dates at that show.""
 'Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (&#8220;SA&#8221;). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 &#8211; Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. PART II Item 8 &#160; Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.

 'In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. A deeper analysis suggests a bullish view for NVIDIA and a bearish view for AMD.\n\nNVIDIA develops graphics processing units (GPUs) semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, creative design, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, AMD designs processors and related technologies for AI, data centers, gaming, and business-computing applications.\n\nShares of NVDA are up 240% year-to-date. Meanwhile, AMD stock has gained 93% year-to-date, including a 20% return over the last three months.\n\nDespite NVIDIA’s much higher gains this year, it’s trading at a much lower valuation than AMD. We’ll look at their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is currently trading at a P/E of 46.4 versus its three-year average P/E of 29.9.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of around 64.3, NVIDIA is trading at a relatively small premium to its industry (compared to AMD’s premium anyway). In fact, the stock hasn’t been this cheap in a year, and its long-term gains also suggest a bullish view might be appropriate despite the tremendous year-to-date gain.\n\nOn a P/E basis, NVIDIA hasn’t been this cheap since December 2022. In fact, NVIDIA was trading at a P/E of over 100 just days ago — before the last earnings report. Of course, significantly higher earnings send a company’s P/E much lower if its stock price doesn’t change dramatically.\n\nIn NVIDIA’s case, its earnings exploded so much higher year-over-year that its P/E was cut nearly in half after just a small pullback from around $500 a share on November 22 to $489 on November 24. For its third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.02 per share on $18.1 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of $3.37 per share on $16.2 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a comparative basis, NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, while its adjusted earnings rose nearly sevenfold year-over-year and 49% quarter-over-quarter. The chipmaker’s GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings rose more than 13 times from a year ago to $3.71 per share, also demonstrating exploding growth.\n\nBefore that earnings report, NVIDIA shares had soared to a record high of around $505 with a P/E of about 120 in November. Normally, I wouldn’t suggest a bullish view of a stock that has risen so much, so fast.\n\nHowever, once the market recognizes its lower valuation — and recovers from management’s warning about significantly lower sales to China and other countries due to export restrictions — NVIDIA shares will likely continue their tear. Despite that warning, the chipmaker still guided for almost 231% revenue growth to $20 billion in the fourth quarter, so it clearly isn’t all that worried.\n\nEven if the stock doesn’t recover dramatically in the near term, NVIDIA’s long-term stock-price gains of 267% over the last three years, 1,184% over the last five, and 13,066% over the last 10 provide some level of safety over the long term. In fact, I would use any near-term pullbacks to add to the position.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $660.39, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies upside potential of 36.7%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAt a P/E of 1,120, Advanced Micro Devices has the opposite problem of NVIDIA. Its valuation has skyrocketed because it’s now barely profitable. However, the chipmaker certainly isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so it’s only a matter of time before it bounces back. For now, though, a bearish view seems appropriate, pending a better entry price or improved earnings numbers.\n\nIn the third quarter, AMD reported $299 million in GAAP net income, although that was an improvement from net income of $66 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company’s net income rose 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. AMD also reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the quarter, up from $5.6 billion a year ago.\n\nUnfortunately, AMD continues to play catch-up to NVIDIA in the area of artificial intelligence, although management did reveal some progress on its last earnings call, announcing improvements in the company’s AI software capabilities through R&D and acquisitions. Management also expects the MI300 data center chip, which will support AI models, to be “the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.” In short, AMD will likely catch up to NVIDIA at some point, but we’re not there yet.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for AMD Stock?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $126.79, the average AMD stock price target implies upside potential of 2.9%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on NVDA, Bearish on AMD\n\nThe battle between NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices has been going on for years, with one company pulling out in front of the other and then the other catching up and trading places. Nonetheless, neither of these companies is going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nHowever, AMD could be playing catch-up to NVIDIA on AI for some time, calling for a wait-and-see approach. Meanwhile, NVIDIA will likely rerate higher once the market digests management’s warning about the new export restrictions.\n\nDisclosure'

PLEASE REVIEW","['This morning is an important one for AMD – perhaps the most important of the year. After almost a year and a half of build-up, and even longer for actual development, AMD is launching their next generation GPU/APU/AI accelerator family, the Instinct MI300 series. Based on AMD\'s new CDNA 3 architecture, and combining it with AMD\'s proven Zen 4 cores, AMD will be making a full-court press for the high-end GPU and accelerator market with their new product, aiming to lead in both big-metal HPC as well as the burgeoning market for generative AI training and inference.\n\nTaking the stage for AMD\'s launch event will be AMD CEO Dr. LIsa Su, as well as a numerous AMD executives and ecosystem partners, to detail, at last, AMD\'s latest generation GPU architecture, and the many forms it will come in. With both the MI300X accelerator and MI300A APU, AMD is aiming to cover most of the accelerator market, whether clients just need a powerful GPU or a tightly-coupled GPU/CPU pairing.\n\nThe stakes for today\'s announcement are significant. The market for generative AI is all but hardware constrained at the moment, much to the benefit of (and profits for) AMD\'s rival NVIDIA. So AMD is hoping to capitalize on this moment to cut off a piece – perhaps a very big piece – of the market for generative AI accelerators. AMD has made breaking into the server space their highest priority over the last half-decade, and now, they believe, is their time to take a big piece of the server GPU market.\n\n12:56PM EST - We\'re here in San Jose for AMD\'s final and most important launch event of the year: Advancing AI\n\n12:57PM EST - Today AMD is making the eagerly anticipated launch of their next-generation MI300 series of accelerators\n\n12:58PM EST - Including MI300A, their first chiplet-based server APU, and MI300X, their stab at the most powerful GPU/accelerator possible for the AI market\n\n12:59PM EST - I\'d say the event is being held in AMD\'s backyard, but since AMD sold their campus here in the bay area several years ago, this is more like NVIDIA\'s backyard. Which is fitting, given that AMD is looking to capture a piece of the highly profitable Generative AI market from NVIDIA\n\n12:59PM EST - We\'re supposed to start at 10am local time here - so in another minute or so\n\n12:59PM EST - And hey, here we go.

PLEASE REVIEW","['This morning is an important one for AMD – perhaps the most important of the year. After almost a year and a half of build-up, and even longer for actual development, AMD is launching their next generation GPU/APU/AI accelerator family, the Instinct MI300 series. Based on AMD\'s new CDNA 3 architecture, and combining it with AMD\'s proven Zen 4 cores, AMD will be making a full-court press for the high-end GPU and accelerator market with their new product, aiming to lead in both big-metal HPC as well as the burgeoning market for generative AI training and inference.\n\nTaking the stage for AMD\'s launch event will be AMD CEO Dr. LIsa Su, as well as a numerous AMD executives and ecosystem partners, to detail, at last, AMD\'s latest generation GPU architecture, and the many forms it will come in. With both the MI300X accelerator and MI300A APU, AMD is aiming to cover most of the accelerator market, whether clients just need a powerful GPU or a tightly-coupled GPU/CPU pairing.\n\nThe stakes for today\'s announcement are significant. The market for generative AI is all but hardware constrained at the moment, much to the benefit of (and profits for) AMD\'s rival NVIDIA. So AMD is hoping to capitalize on this moment to cut off a piece – perhaps a very big piece – of the market for generative AI accelerators. AMD has made breaking into the server space their highest priority over the last half-decade, and now, they believe, is their time to take a big piece of the server GPU market.\n\n12:56PM EST - We\'re here in San Jose for AMD\'s final and most important launch event of the year: Advancing AI\n\n12:57PM EST - Today AMD is making the eagerly anticipated launch of their next-generation MI300 series of accelerators\n\n12:58PM EST - Including MI300A, their first chiplet-based server APU, and MI300X, their stab at the most powerful GPU/accelerator possible for the AI market\n\n12:59PM EST - I\'d say the event is being held in AMD\'s backyard, but since AMD sold their campus here in the bay area several years ago, this is more like NVIDIA\'s backyard.

Whether it's a custom computer or a pre-built model, a graphics card is essential for rendering games in high quality, and cards from either Nvidia or AMD are what you'll find in all of the best gaming PCs and best gaming laptops.\n\nBoth brands offer a range of graphics cards with entry-level models starting at around $270 and high-end cards costing $1,500 or more. AMD and Nvidia also allow other manufacturers to sell third-party versions of their cards based on their original specs. This can create price variations among models with similar capabilities, since third-party manufacturers may add features like extra fans or lighting.\n\nWhile there are lots of graphics cards to choose from, it's still possible to compare each brand's overall performance in relation to their price. Premium Nvidia graphics cards are typically viewed as the most powerful when it comes to advanced features, while the best AMD cards have a reputation for being significantly more affordable and energy efficient.\n\nBelow, we've broken down details on all the latest graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD, and compare how they stack up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: Price and features\n\nAMD and Nvidia both offer a range of graphics cards for different budgets and performance needs. Nvidia's current lineup is called the GeForce RTX 40 series, while AMD's lineup is called the Radeon RX 7000 series. Here's a rundown of each series.\n\nNote: The cards listed below are for desktop computers. Both brands also make mobile versions of their cards that PC manufacturers can integrate into their gaming laptops, but performance may vary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the company's most powerful graphics card. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's RTX 40 series debuted in fall 2022 with the release of the flagship GeForce RTX 4080 ($1,199) and the premium RTX 4090 ($1,599); four more affordable RTX 40 series cards arrived in 2023.\n\nRTX 40 series cards share a wide range of features, including raytracing, an advanced lighting feature that requires a compatible graphics card, and DLSS 3.0, the latest version of Nvidia's AI-enhanced upscaling technology that makes games easier to run at high frame rates.\n\nOther Nvidia features are designed to benefit content creators; RTX cards include support for AI-based noise removal for your microphone and virtual backgrounds for your webcam, as well as face tracking and auto-focus. However, AMD reports that its graphics cards actually render video faster than the RTX 40 series with common editing programs like Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve Studio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards\n\nAn AMD Radeon RX 7000 series card being used with an AMD Ryzen CPU. XFX\n\nAMD launched the Radeon RX 7000 series of graphics cards in December 2022 with the RX 7900 XT ($899) and 7900 XTX ($999), followed by the release of several lower priced cards in 2023, including the 7700XT and 7800XT which are set to launch on September 6.\n\nAMD cards offer similar performance to Nvidia cards in most games, and usually for a lower price. For example, Tom's Hardware ranks the RX 7900 XT ($999) ahead of the RTX 4080 ($1,199) in terms of overall performance, despite the AMD card typically being $200 cheaper. However, Nvidia cards tend to reveal bigger advantages when you play newer games with more advanced graphical features.\n\nLike the RTX 40 series, AMD's RX 7000 cards do feature ray tracing, but ray tracing performance generally lags behind the RTX 40 series with slower frame rates. The RX 7000 series also has an AI-based rendering feature to improve frame rates, called FSR, but it's not quite as developed as Nvidia's DLSS.\n\nIf you're looking to play newer releases like Cyberpunk 2077 or Allen Wake 2, a weaker AMD card may struggle to deliver graphics at the highest possible quality. That said, AMD does partner with some developers to boost performance on AMD hardware; for example, Microsoft's Starfield was designed with support for AMD's FSR at release, but not DLSS.\n\nAMD also supports a feature called Smart Access Memory to improve performance when you pair its latest CPUs and GPUs together. This feature allows the CPU to use more of the graphics card's memory. However, some Nvidia and Intel hardware can take advantage of a similar feature, called Resizable Bar, so the underlying tech isn't AMD exclusive.\n\nAMD benchmark data that shows RX 7000 graphics cards outperforming Nvidia hardware exclusively use AMD processors during testing, so if you have an Intel processor, you may want to look at publicly sourced benchmarks before buying an AMD card.\n\n*The target resolution and refresh rates for each graphics card were determined based on benchmarks shared by Nvidia, AMD, and crowd sourced data from the public. The maximum frame rate and resolution possible with each card will vary based on the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: Which graphics card should you choose?\n\nUltimately, choosing between an AMD or Nvidia graphics card comes down to your personal needs, budget, and preferences. Those building their own PC with a smaller budget may prefer the affordability of AMD graphics cards, while those willing to pay more to play brand-new games with graphics that can best the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X will likely want an Nvidia 4080 or 4090 card to maximize performance.\n\nOf course, high-end AMD cards like the RX 7900 XT or RX 7900 XTX are still capable of playing the latest releases, but Nvidia's top models have an edge when you enable advanced features like ray tracing.\n\nFAQs\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat should you know before buying a graphics card?\n\nBefore you buy any graphics card, you should make sure that it's a good fit for your computer. Using an older CPU or motherboard with a brand-new graphics card can limit your overall performance and create bottlenecks that prevent you from getting the most out of your card.\n\nCheck that your motherboard supports the latest specifications, like PCIe 4.0. Newer graphics cards also demand lots of power, so make sure your power supply has enough juice to keep your computer running.\n\nFinally, always measure the inside of your case to make sure the graphics card will physically fit during installation, as different cases can position the graphics card at different angles. Different manufacturers also make different sized versions of the same graphics card to add extra fans or lighting.""]","AMD's recent unveiling of the Instinct MI300 series signals a significant thrust into the realms of AI and high-performance computing, seeking to bridge the gap in a market where Nvidia has traditionally excelled, especially in the lucrative sector of generative AI.

PLEASE REVIEW","['Billions of people use Facebook and Instagram every day to share the ups and downs of life, to connect with people who share their interests, and to discover content they enjoy. To make everyone’s experience on our apps unique and personalized to them, we use AI systems to decide what content appears, informed by the choices they make.\n\nI wrote previously about the relationship between you and the algorithms Meta uses to shape what you see on Facebook and Instagram, and to challenge the myth that algorithms leave people powerless over the content they see. In that piece, I wrote that we needed to be more frank about how this relationship works and to give you more control over what you see.\n\nToday, we’re building on that commitment by being more transparent around several of the AI systems that incorporate your feedback to rank content across Facebook and Instagram. These systems make it more likely that the posts you see are relevant and interesting to you. We’re also making it clearer how you can better control what you see on our apps, as well as testing new controls and making others more accessible. And we’re giving more detailed information for experts so they can better understand and analyze our systems.\n\nThis is part of a wider ethos of openness, transparency and accountability. With rapid advances taking place with powerful technologies like generative AI, it’s understandable that people are both excited by the possibilities and concerned about the risks. We believe that the best way to respond to those concerns is with openness. Generally speaking, we believe that as these technologies are developed, companies should be more open about how their systems work and collaborate openly across industry, government and civil society to help ensure they are developed responsibly. That starts with giving you more insight into, and control over, the content you see.\n\nHow AI Predictions Influence Recommendations\n\nOur AI systems predict how valuable a piece of content might be to you, so we can show it to you sooner. For example, sharing a post is often an indicator that you found that post to be interesting, so predicting that you will share a post is one factor our systems take into account. As you might imagine, no single prediction is a perfect gauge of whether a post is valuable to you. So we use a wide variety of predictions in combination to get as close as possible to the right content, including some based on behavior and some based on user feedback received through surveys.\n\nWe want to be more open about how this works. A model of transparency Meta has been developing and advocating for some time is the publication of system cards, which give people insight into how our systems work in a way that is accessible for those who don’t have deep technical knowledge. Today, we are releasing 22 system cards for Facebook and Instagram. They give information about how our AI systems rank content, some of the predictions each system makes to determine what content might be most relevant to you, as well as the controls you can use to help customize your experience. They cover Feed, Stories, Reels and other surfaces where people go to find content from the accounts or people they follow. The system cards also cover AI systems that recommend “unconnected” content from people, groups, or accounts they don’t follow. You can find a more detailed explanation of the AI behind content recommendations here.\n\nTo give a further level of detail beyond what’s published in the system cards, we’re sharing the types of inputs – known as signals – as well as the predictive models these signals inform that help determine what content you will find most relevant from your network on Facebook. The categories of signals we’re releasing represent the vast majority of signals currently used in Facebook Feed ranking for this content. You can find these signals and predictions in the Transparency Center, along with how frequently they tend to be used in the overall ranking process.\n\nWe also use signals to help identify harmful content, which we remove as we become aware of it, as well as to help reduce the distribution of other types of problematic or low-quality content in line with our Content Distribution Guidelines. We’re including some examples of the signals we use to do this. But there’s a limit to what we can disclose safely. While we want to be transparent about how we try to keep bad content away from people’s Feeds, we also need to be careful not to disclose signals which might make it easier for people to circumvent our defenses.\n\nOf course, not everyone will find information just because we publish it on our website. That’s why we make it possible to see details directly in our apps about why our systems predicted content would be relevant to you, and the types of activity and inputs that may have led to that prediction. We’re expanding our “Why Am I Seeing This?” feature in Instagram Reels tab and Explore, and Facebook Reels in the coming weeks, after previously launching it for some Feed content and all ads on both Facebook and Instagram. You’ll be able to click on an individual reel to see more information about how your previous activity may have informed the machine learning models that shape and deliver the reels you see.\n\nExpanding Tools to Personalize Your Experience\n\nBy using the tools available, you have the ability to shape your experiences on our apps so you see more of the content you want to see, and less of the content you don’t. To make this easier, we’ve created centralized places on Facebook and Instagram where you can customize controls that influence the content you see on each app. You can visit your Feed Preferences on Facebook and the Suggested Content Control Center on Instagram through the three-dot menu on relevant posts, as well as through Settings.\n\nOn Instagram, we’re testing a new feature that makes it possible for you to indicate that you’re “Interested” in a recommended reel in the Reels tab, so we can show you more of what you like. The “Not Interested” feature has been available since 2021. You can learn more about influencing what you see across Instagram here.\n\nSo you can customize your experience and the content you see, we also have a “Show more, Show less” feature on Facebook, which is available on all posts in Feed, Video, and Reels via the three-dot-menu. We’re working on ways to make the feature even more prominent. And if you don’t want an algorithmically-ranked Feed – or just want to see what your Feed would look like without it – you can use the Feeds tab on Facebook or select Following on Instagram to switch to a chronological Feed. You can also add people to your Favorites list on both Facebook and Instagram so you can always see content from your favorite accounts.\n\nProviding Better Tools for Researchers\n\nWe also believe an open approach to research and innovation – especially when it comes to transformative AI technologies – is better than leaving the know-how in the hands of a small number of big tech companies. That’s why we’ve released over 1,000 AI models, libraries and data sets for researchers over the last decade so they can benefit from our computing power and pursue research openly and safely. It is our ambition to continue to be transparent as we make more AI models openly available in future.\n\nIn the next few weeks, we will start rolling out a new suite of tools for researchers: Meta Content Library and API. The Library includes data from public posts, pages, groups, and events on Facebook. For Instagram, it will include public posts and data from creator and business accounts. Data from the Library can be searched, explored, and filtered on a graphical user interface or through a programmatic API. Researchers from qualified academic and research institutions pursuing scientific or public interest research topics will be able to apply for access to these tools through partners with deep expertise in secure data sharing for research, starting with the University of Michigan’s Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. These tools will provide the most comprehensive access to publicly-available content across Facebook and Instagram of any research tool we have built to date and also help us meet new data-sharing and transparency compliance obligations.\n\nWe hope by introducing these products to researchers early in the development process, we can receive constructive feedback to ensure we’re building the best possible tools to meet their needs.'
 'In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.\n\nWith such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\n\nAt a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P/S. Thus, it looks much more reasonably valued than NVIDIA, especially considering its five-year mean P/S of eight. However, a neutral view might be appropriate in the near term due to the geopolitical overhang for Taiwanese stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enjoyed a nice 11% lift over the last five days due to NVIDIA’s good news, enjoying their best week in almost a year. TSM is likely to see some sales increase from the AI transition because it manufactures NVIDIA’s chips, but any impact is likely to be modest.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could face issues amid the growing tensions between Taiwan and China, which convinced Warren Buffett to dump most of his $4.1 billion stake after less than a year. Given Buffett’s long-term focus, it’s highly unusual that he would sell the position after holding it for such a short time.\n\nThus, while Taiwan Semiconductor could end up being an excellent long-term investment at current prices, the recent rally paired with the geopolitical tensions suggests a neutral view for now.\n\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sells assigned over the last three months. At $118.67, the average Taiwan Semiconductor stock price target implies upside potential of 19.93%.\n\nConclusion: Bearish on NVDA, Neutral on TSM\n\nNVIDIA and TSM clearly have excellent long-term prospects, given their AI exposure. However, it seems like buying NVIDIA shares at current prices could be playing with fire, given its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price.\n\nTSM’s valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI, but the geopolitical overhang adds significant risk to owning the shares.\n\nDisclosure']","While both NVIDIA and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) have seen substantial growth, their market performances reflect different investor sentiments. NVIDIA's soaring stock price, driven by its expansion into AI and generative technologies, has led to concerns about its valuation and potential bubble-like aspects. Conversely, TSM's more moderate stock growth, influenced by geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, suggests a cautious approach despite its strong position in the semiconductor industry. These factors highlight the importance of considering both growth potential and external risks in investment decisions.",156,0.49999999995,1.0,0.9177701345090012,1.0,0.26666666648888887

PLEASE REVIEW","['Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (&#8220;SA&#8221;). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 &#8211; Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. PART II Item 8 &#160; Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.

 'Companies broaden scope of mobile graphics collaboration to bring leadership\n\nAMD Radeon graphics technology to expanded portfolio of Samsung Exynos SoCs\n\nSamsung Electronics, a world leader in advanced semiconductor technology, and AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced they have signed a multi-year agreement extension to bring multiple generations of high-performance, ultra-low-power AMD Radeon graphics solutions to an expanded portfolio of Samsung Exynos SoCs. Through the licensing extension, Samsung will bring console-level graphics quality and optimized power consumption to more mobile devices, offering an incredibly immersive and long-lasting gaming experience.\n\n“Together with AMD, Samsung has been revolutionizing mobile graphics, including our recent collaboration that brought ray tracing capability to mobile processors for the first time in the industry,” said Seogjun Lee, Executive Vice President of Application Processor (AP) Development at Samsung Electronics. “Drawing on our technological know-how in designing ultra-low-power solutions, we will continue to drive ongoing innovation in the mobile graphics space.”\n\n“We are excited Samsung selected multiple generations of our leadership high-performance Radeon graphics to advance the next generation of Samsung Exynos solutions,” said David Wang, Senior Vice President of the Radeon Technologies Group at AMD. “The extension of our work with Samsung is a testament to our strong technology partnership and commitment to bring the best experiences possible to mobile users.”\n\nSamsung and AMD first announced their partnership to license AMD RDNA™ graphics architecture in 2019, leading to the co-development of Samsung Xclipse, a mobile graphics processing unit (GPU) based on the AMD RDNA 2 architecture in 2022. Xclipse was the industry’s first mobile GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing and variable rate shading features for console-like gameplay on mobile devices.'
 'In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. A deeper analysis suggests a bullish view for NVIDIA and a bearish view for AMD.\n\nNVIDIA develops graphics processing units (GPUs) semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, creative design, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, AMD designs processors and related technologies for AI, data centers, gaming, and business-computing applications.\n\nShares of NVDA are up 240% year-to-date. Meanwhile, AMD stock has gained 93% year-to-date, including a 20% return over the last three months.\n\nDespite NVIDIA’s much higher gains this year, it’s trading at a much lower valuation than AMD. We’ll look at their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is currently trading at a P/E of 46.4 versus its three-year average P/E of 29.9.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of around 64.3, NVIDIA is trading at a relatively small premium to its industry (compared to AMD’s premium anyway). In fact, the stock hasn’t been this cheap in a year, and its long-term gains also suggest a bullish view might be appropriate despite the tremendous year-to-date gain.\n\nOn a P/E basis, NVIDIA hasn’t been this cheap since December 2022. In fact, NVIDIA was trading at a P/E of over 100 just days ago — before the last earnings report. Of course, significantly higher earnings send a company’s P/E much lower if its stock price doesn’t change dramatically.\n\nIn NVIDIA’s case, its earnings exploded so much higher year-over-year that its P/E was cut nearly in half after just a small pullback from around $500 a share on November 22 to $489 on November 24. For its third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.02 per share on $18.1 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of $3.37 per share on $16.2 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a comparative basis, NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, while its adjusted earnings rose nearly sevenfold year-over-year and 49% quarter-over-quarter. The chipmaker’s GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings rose more than 13 times from a year ago to $3.71 per share, also demonstrating exploding growth.\n\nBefore that earnings report, NVIDIA shares had soared to a record high of around $505 with a P/E of about 120 in November. Normally, I wouldn’t suggest a bullish view of a stock that has risen so much, so fast.\n\nHowever, once the market recognizes its lower valuation — and recovers from management’s warning about significantly lower sales to China and other countries due to export restrictions — NVIDIA shares will likely continue their tear. Despite that warning, the chipmaker still guided for almost 231% revenue growth to $20 billion in the fourth quarter, so it clearly isn’t all that worried.\n\nEven if the stock doesn’t recover dramatically in the near term, NVIDIA’s long-term stock-price gains of 267% over the last three years, 1,184% over the last five, and 13,066% over the last 10 provide some level of safety over the long term. In fact, I would use any near-term pullbacks to add to the position.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $660.39, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies upside potential of 36.7%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAt a P/E of 1,120, Advanced Micro Devices has the opposite problem of NVIDIA. Its valuation has skyrocketed because it’s now barely profitable. However, the chipmaker certainly isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so it’s only a matter of time before it bounces back. For now, though, a bearish view seems appropriate, pending a better entry price or improved earnings numbers.\n\nIn the third quarter, AMD reported $299 million in GAAP net income, although that was an improvement from net income of $66 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company’s net income rose 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. AMD also reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the quarter, up from $5.6 billion a year ago.\n\nUnfortunately, AMD continues to play catch-up to NVIDIA in the area of artificial intelligence, although management did reveal some progress on its last earnings call, announcing improvements in the company’s AI software capabilities through R&D and acquisitions. Management also expects the MI300 data center chip, which will support AI models, to be “the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.” In short, AMD will likely catch up to NVIDIA at some point, but we’re not there yet.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for AMD Stock?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $126.79, the average AMD stock price target implies upside potential of 2.9%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on NVDA, Bearish on AMD\n\nThe battle between NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices has been going on for years, with one company pulling out in front of the other and then the other catching up and trading places. Nonetheless, neither of these companies is going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nHowever, AMD could be playing catch-up to NVIDIA on AI for some time, calling for a wait-and-see approach. Meanwhile, NVIDIA will likely rerate higher once the market digests management’s warning about the new export restrictions.\n\nDisclosure'

Which chip manufacturers does Microsoft use?,"Based on the information gathered, Microsoft has been involved in custom-designed processors tailored for AI and computing tasks. However, the specific chip manufacturers used by Microsoft are not explicitly mentioned in the provided data.","['This morning is an important one for AMD – perhaps the most important of the year. After almost a year and a half of build-up, and even longer for actual development, AMD is launching their next generation GPU/APU/AI accelerator family, the Instinct MI300 series. Based on AMD\'s new CDNA 3 architecture, and combining it with AMD\'s proven Zen 4 cores, AMD will be making a full-court press for the high-end GPU and accelerator market with their new product, aiming to lead in both big-metal HPC as well as the burgeoning market for generative AI training and inference.\n\nTaking the stage for AMD\'s launch event will be AMD CEO Dr. LIsa Su, as well as a numerous AMD executives and ecosystem partners, to detail, at last, AMD\'s latest generation GPU architecture, and the many forms it will come in. With both the MI300X accelerator and MI300A APU, AMD is aiming to cover most of the accelerator market, whether clients just need a powerful GPU or a tightly-coupled GPU/CPU pairing.\n\nThe stakes for today\'s announcement are significant. The market for generative AI is all but hardware constrained at the moment, much to the benefit of (and profits for) AMD\'s rival NVIDIA. So AMD is hoping to capitalize on this moment to cut off a piece – perhaps a very big piece – of the market for generative AI accelerators. AMD has made breaking into the server space their highest priority over the last half-decade, and now, they believe, is their time to take a big piece of the server GPU market.\n\n12:56PM EST - We\'re here in San Jose for AMD\'s final and most important launch event of the year: Advancing AI\n\n12:57PM EST - Today AMD is making the eagerly anticipated launch of their next-generation MI300 series of accelerators\n\n12:58PM EST - Including MI300A, their first chiplet-based server APU, and MI300X, their stab at the most powerful GPU/accelerator possible for the AI market\n\n12:59PM EST - I\'d say the event is being held in AMD\'s backyard, but since AMD sold their campus here in the bay area several years ago, this is more like NVIDIA\'s backyard. Which is fitting, given that AMD is looking to capture a piece of the highly profitable Generative AI market from NVIDIA\n\n12:59PM EST - We\'re supposed to start at 10am local time here - so in another minute or so\n\n12:59PM EST - And hey, here we go.

 'Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Revenue Recognition Revenue Allowances For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development Arrangements Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.

Compute grew 266% due to higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform for the training and inference of LLMs, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. Networking was up 133% due to higher shipments of InfiniBand. Graphics revenue &#8211; The year-on-year increase was led by growth in Gaming of 15% driven by higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels. Reportable segment operating income &#8211; The year-on-year increase in Compute &#38; Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue. All Other operating loss - The year-on-year decrease was due to the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a $839 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2024.

 ""Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) have gone on an impressive run over the past couple of weeks, rising 12.6% in thirty days, including 5% gains over the past week alone to reach an all-time high of $371.95 on Tuesday. The Satya Nadella-led tech giant now has a market cap of $2.75 trillion.\n\nWith the stock up 54% year to date, compared with a 17% rise in the S&P 500 index, there’s no question that the market has fallen in love with Microsoft, particularly on the heels of the company’s Q1 2024 earnings results, which showed better-than-expected growth at its Azure cloud unit. Q1 revenues beat consensus expectations by a significant margin, coming in at $56.5 billion. Not only was that ahead of consensus by 4%, it translates to a 13% growth year over year.\n\nThe revenue beat was driven by strong demand in the personal computing segment, intelligent cloud segment and productivity and business processes segment, which beat Street estimates by 7%, 3% and 2% respectively. Just as impressive, during the quarter, Azure revenue grew almost 30% year over year. Notably, Azure revenue surpassed the high end of the company’s own guidance by two percentage points.\n\nIn terms of profits, Microsoft delivered $40.2 billion, thanks to 16% rise in gross profit, which beat consensus by 7%. Owing to the strength of Azure and Office 365, Q1 gross margin improved three percentage points sequentially, all of which contributed to a 25% year over year rise in operating income which reached $26.9 billion. Thanks to higher gross margins, operating income beat consensus by 12%, underscoring the efficiency-focused management team.\n\nDuring the quarter, Microsoft also shared that AI Services contributed 3 points, and that's really where the fun begins. It's hard to ignore Microsoft’s early dominance in realm of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which has been the main driver of the stock so far in 2023. The generative AI market is currently growing at 42% and could hit $1.3 trillion by 2032, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. The bulk of the revenue growth from generative AI, estimated $247 billion by 2032, will come from demand for the infrastructure needed to train AI models.\n\nWhat's more, estimates suggests that the AI-assisted digital ads business could reach $192 billion in annual revenue by 2032, while revenue from AI servers could hit $134 billion. Given these immense capabilities, as well as AI’s ability to learn and solve problems like humans by using (among other things) advanced form of computer processing, the money-making potential is immense. The fact that AI Services contributed just 3 points to Microsoft’s bottom line during Q1 shows just how nascent the AI market still remains.\n\nHaving already deployed its AI services to more regions compared to its competitors, Microsoft announced that its next-generation H100 Virtual Machines will soon be available. Microsoft’s AI advances became known with ChatGPT by way of its $10 billion investment in OpenAI, giving Microsoft 33% ownership of the company. OpenAI’s ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing technology in history, hitting 2 billion users after only six months. Estimates suggests it can reach 3.4 billion global users by the end of 2023.\n\nMicrosoft is aiming to accelerate the pace of adoption and is now extending its AI leadership by finding ways to attract AI startups and digital-first companies to Azure by developing OpenAI APIs. Estimates are calling for Microsoft ’s AI growth prospects to get a 33% boost over the next several quarters. Last week, while citing the company’s deployment of artificial intelligence, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill referred to Microsoft as one of the best buy cycles seen in a long time.\n\nIn other words, even as Microsoft stock is sitting at all-time highs, there is plenty of value to be realized with its AI-driven focus.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.""

PLEASE REVIEW","['NVIDIA Corporation NVDA formally launched a China-specific lower version of its most powerful gaming chip, which complies with the U.S. restrictions on the company’s export of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips to that country.\n\nThe graphic chip maker unveiled RTX 4090D on Thursday, which is available for sale on its China website. The newly launched graphic processing unit (GPU) has a reduced AI inference performance than the RTX 4090 sold in other countries.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, the chip has approximately 10% fewer processing cores than the RTX 4090. NVIDIA has also undertaken measures to prevent end-users from modifying the China-specific chip into a regular RTX 4090.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nNVIDIA Caught in the US-China Tech War\n\nOver the past year, President Joe Biden\'s administration has been imposing trade restrictions to restrict China from getting its hands on cutting-edge technologies that can strengthen its military. Last year, the U.S. government restricted NVIDIA from selling its A100, A100X and H100 integrated circuits to China and Russia. It also banned the company from exporting DGX or other systems using A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\n\nIn October 2023, the Biden administration imposed fresh restrictions on the sale of AI chips and manufacturing equipment to China. The newly expanded restrictions have blocked NVIDIA from selling two AI chips — A800 and H800 — specifically created for the Chinese market following last year’s export curb.\n\nNVIDIA had cautioned that the restrictions may hurt its business in China. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company revealed that it may be forced to discontinue its business operations from countries on the U.S. government’s export restriction list. The rules are expected to impact NVDA’s ability to support its existing customers and complete the development of certain products in a timely manner.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, by launching the less powerful version of RTX 4090, which complies with all US restrictions, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company will be able to boost its sales in China. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nGenAI Investment Aids NVIDIA’s Growth\n\nNVIDIA has witnessed a remarkable run, showcasing a staggering 243% year-to-date surge in its stock price. The company also achieved a massive milestone in May 2023 by joining the exclusive club of companies with a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nNVIDIA’s robust stock price performance has been primarily driven by hopes that the company will be a prime beneficiary of growing investments in generative AI. The company dominates the market for AI chips. The meteoric rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its adoption among enterprises have already proven generative AI technology’s usefulness across multiple industries, including marketing, advertising, customer service, education, content creation, healthcare, automotive, energy & utilities and video game development.\n\nHowever, generative AI requires vast knowledge to create content and needs huge computational power. As a result, enterprises looking to create generative AI-based applications will be required to upgrade their existing network infrastructure.\n\nNVIDIA’s next-generation chips with high computing power can be the top choice for enterprises. The company’s GPUs are already being applied in AI models. This is expanding NVDA’s footprint in untapped markets like automotive, healthcare and manufacturing.\n\nThe generative AI revolution is likely to create huge demand for its next-generation high computing powerful chips. Considering surging AI investments across the data center end market, NVDA expects its fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues to reach $20 billion from $6.05 billion in the year-ago quarter.\n\nOther Companies Banking on AI Investment\n\nAs organizations pivot toward digital transformation, AI investments are set to soar in the coming years, becoming pivotal to staying competitive in the digital landscape. The latest projection from the International Data Corporation forecasts a monumental surge, estimating global AI spending to surpass $300 billion by 2026, indicating a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27% from 2022 to 2026.\n\nTech behemoths like Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Intel Corporation INTC and UiPath Inc. PATH are seizing the immense potential of the AI sector.\n\nMeta is amplifying its presence in the AI realm with the groundbreaking Large Language Model Meta AI, or ""Llama.""

 'You’ve obviously heard of the Steam Deck, and perhaps Asus drew your attention to the upcoming ROG Ally with its not-an-April-Fools’-joke. But that’s apparently just the tip of the iceberg for AMD-powered Steam Deck rivals, which have at least four handhelds based on slivers of silicon the chipmaker has yet to reveal.\n\nOne of the reasons we got so excited about the Asus ROG Ally is that Asus hinted it might be the first handheld since Steam Deck to offer a custom part specifically tuned for portables — and a growing body of leaks suggests that collaboration with AMD is called the Ryzen Z1.\n\nAnd today, Geekbench leaks (which should always be taken with a grain of salt) suggest Asus may actually be using two such chips: a six-core, 12-thread Ryzen Z1 with two RDNA 3 graphics compute units (CUs) and an eight-core, 16-thread Ryzen Z1 Extreme with six RNDA3 CUs, which could have higher performance and power consumption.\n\nBut get this. A shipping manifest spotted by VideoCardz also shows an ROG Ally with another unannounced name: the Ryzen 7 7840U, a 3.3GHz chip with Radeon 780M graphics that’s suspected to be all but identical to that Z1 Extreme.\n\nAnd that Ryzen 7 7840U appears to be very much not exclusive to Asus — it has now been tipped for the Aokzoe A1 Pro, an unannounced Ayaneo 2S, and a GPD Win Mini clamshell, according to rumors and leaks.\n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time those boutique portable PC makers have attempted to challenge the Steam Deck. A year ago, I wrote how they were all gearing up with the off-the-shelf AMD 6800U laptop chip, which sadly didn’t turn out to be efficient enough for a competent portable. (Read my Ayaneo 2 review for details.)\n\nBut Aokzoe, at least, seems pretty confident that it can match the Steam Deck with a 7840U: it’s been posting video after video of its A1 Pro’s performance to YouTube, including one tiny clip where the A1 Pro is running the same game at the same processor wattage and with similar battery drain to the Steam Deck and still manages to run notably faster.\n\nIf that’s what a 7840U can do, I’m heartened. (It wouldn’t be too much of a surprise considering we’re looking at Zen 4 and RDNA 3 instead of the Zen 2 and RDNA 2 in the Steam Deck’s Aerith chip.)\n\nBut it’s just a tiny glimpse for now, and we don’t know whether any of these companies can hit the right price with these chips or get Microsoft’s help to turn Windows into something easy and comfortable to use on a gaming handheld. And AMD didn’t immediately respond to a request for this story.\n\nAnother thing that heartens me, though:\n\nLast July, when I reached out to my AMD PR contacts about handheld gaming PCs, they told me they didn’t even have a contact who could handle such a request, adding:\n\nWe do not have any further details to share at this time regarding AMD chips in handheld gaming PCs. We’ll certainly be in touch with news and opportunities as it relates to AMD in the future but unfortunately at this time are not able to connect you directly.'
 'In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.\n\nWith such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\n\nAt a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P/S. Thus, it looks much more reasonably valued than NVIDIA, especially considering its five-year mean P/S of eight. However, a neutral view might be appropriate in the near term due to the geopolitical overhang for Taiwanese stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enjoyed a nice 11% lift over the last five days due to NVIDIA’s good news, enjoying their best week in almost a year. TSM is likely to see some sales increase from the AI transition because it manufactures NVIDIA’s chips, but any impact is likely to be modest.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could face issues amid the growing tensions between Taiwan and China, which convinced Warren Buffett to dump most of his $4.1 billion stake after less than a year. Given Buffett’s long-term focus, it’s highly unusual that he would sell the position after holding it for such a short time.\n\nThus, while Taiwan Semiconductor could end up being an excellent long-term investment at current prices, the recent rally paired with the geopolitical tensions suggests a neutral view for now.\n\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sells assigned over the last three months. At $118.67, the average Taiwan Semiconductor stock price target implies upside potential of 19.93%.\n\nConclusion: Bearish on NVDA, Neutral on TSM\n\nNVIDIA and TSM clearly have excellent long-term prospects, given their AI exposure. However, it seems like buying NVIDIA shares at current prices could be playing with fire, given its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price.\n\nTSM’s valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI, but the geopolitical overhang adds significant risk to owning the shares.\n\nDisclosure'

 'AMD is coming for Nvidia’s AI crown in a big way with the launch of its new Instinct processor, which it claims can do the work of multiple GPUs.\n\nCEO Lisa Su called the Instinct MI300X “the most complex thing we’ve ever built.” She held up the chip, which is about the size of a drink coaster, at an event on Tuesday in San Francisco.\n\nWeighing in at 146 billion transistors, the MI300X comes with up to 192GB of high-bandwidth HBM3 memory shared by both the CPU and GPU. It has a total of 13 chiplets on the die. The chip also has a memory bandwidth of 5.2 TB/s, which is 60% faster than Nvidia’s H100.\n\nThe chip consists of Zen CPU cores and AMD’s next-generation CDNA 3 GPU architecture. The enormous amount of memory is the real selling point, according to Su.\n\n“If you look at the industry today, you often see that, first of all, the model sizes are getting much larger. And you actually need multiple GPUs to run the latest large language models,” she said. “With MI300X, you can reduce the number of GPUs for this, and as model sizes continue growing, this will become even more important. So with more memory, more memory bandwidth, and fewer GPUs needed.”\n\nAMD says the design of the MI300X makes it eight times more powerful than the existing MI250X used in Frontier (the world’s fastest supercomputer) and five times more energy efficient. It will be used in the two-plus exaFLOP El Capitan system that will be built next year at Lawrence Livermore National Labs.']","Nvidia is the market leader in the AI chip market. Facing some geopolitical risk with China due to the chip ban, Nvidia manufactures RTX 4090D as an alternative to sell to Chinese market, alleviates some risk factor. Nvidia's competitor AMD also releases Instinct MI300X to compete with Nvidia's H100 GPU, putting more pressure to Nvidia. However, Nvidia is still favorable to investors, displaying over 200% increase in stock price in 2023. TSMC is one of the chip manufacture for Nvidia, and the geopolical impact of China might also affect TSMC.

PLEASE REVIEW","['Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Revenue Recognition Revenue Allowances For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development Arrangements Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below.

 'Users in India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria repr esented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during December 2023, relative to the same period in 2022. &#8226; Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook. As of December 31, 2023, we had 3.07 billion MAUs, an increase of 3% from December 31, 2022. Users in India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria represented the top three sources of growth in 2023, relative to the same period in 2022. Table of Contents Trends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. See ""Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)"" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States &#38; Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2023 in the United States &#38; Canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region. --- ARPU: -- $11.57 --- $9.54 --- $9.82 --- $9.41 --- $10.86 ---- $9.62 ---- $10.63 ---- $11.23 --- $13.12 - - -- ARPU: -- $60.57 -- $48.29 -- $50.25 -- $49.13 --- $58.77 -- $48.85 --- $53.53 --- $56.11 --- $68.44 -------- ARPU: -- $19.68 -- $15.35 -- $15.64 -- $14.23 -- $17.29 --- $15.51 -- $17.88 --- $19.04 --- $23.14 - ARPU: -- $4.89 ---- $4.47 ---- $4.54 ---- $4.42 ---- $4.61 ---- $4.52 ---- $4.88 ----- $5.12 ---- $5.52 ------- ARPU: -- $3.43 ----- $3.14 ---- $3.35 ---- $3.21 ---- $3.52 ---- $3.35 ---- $3.76 ----- $4.22 ---- $4.50 ##TABLE_START Ad Revenue Non-Ad Revenue ##TABLE_END Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources. Table of Contents Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 &#8212; Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplemental Data"" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers. Our annual worldwide ARPU in 2023, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $44.60, an increase of 13% from 2022. For 2023, ARPU increased by 21% in Europe, 20% in Rest of World, 11% in Asia-Pacific, and 10% in United States &#38; Canada. User growth was mostly in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia&#8209;Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region. Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates.

 'In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.\n\nWith such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\n\nAt a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P/S. Thus, it looks much more reasonably valued than NVIDIA, especially considering its five-year mean P/S of eight. However, a neutral view might be appropriate in the near term due to the geopolitical overhang for Taiwanese stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enjoyed a nice 11% lift over the last five days due to NVIDIA’s good news, enjoying their best week in almost a year. TSM is likely to see some sales increase from the AI transition because it manufactures NVIDIA’s chips, but any impact is likely to be modest.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could face issues amid the growing tensions between Taiwan and China, which convinced Warren Buffett to dump most of his $4.1 billion stake after less than a year. Given Buffett’s long-term focus, it’s highly unusual that he would sell the position after holding it for such a short time.\n\nThus, while Taiwan Semiconductor could end up being an excellent long-term investment at current prices, the recent rally paired with the geopolitical tensions suggests a neutral view for now.\n\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sells assigned over the last three months. At $118.67, the average Taiwan Semiconductor stock price target implies upside potential of 19.93%.\n\nConclusion: Bearish on NVDA, Neutral on TSM\n\nNVIDIA and TSM clearly have excellent long-term prospects, given their AI exposure. However, it seems like buying NVIDIA shares at current prices could be playing with fire, given its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price.\n\nTSM’s valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI, but the geopolitical overhang adds significant risk to owning the shares.\n\nDisclosure'
 'AI is enabling new forms of connection and expression, thanks to the power of generative technologies. And today at Connect, we introduced you to new AI experiences and features that can enhance your connections with others – and give you the tools to be more creative, expressive, and productive.\n\nAI Stickers\n\nBillions of stickers are sent across our platforms every month, adding another fun and creative way for people to communicate and express themselves. Today, we announced new AI stickers that enable you to effortlessly generate customized stickers for your chats and stories. Using technology from Llama 2 and our foundational model for image generation called Emu, our AI tool turns your text prompts into multiple unique, high-quality stickers in seconds. This new feature, which is rolling out to select English-language users over the next month in WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and Facebook Stories, provides infinitely more options to convey how you’re feeling at any moment. AI stickers will roll out to select English language users over the next month.\n\nImage Editing With AI\n\nSoon, you’ll be able to transform your images or even co-create AI-generated images with friends. Restyle and backdrop – two new features that are coming soon to Instagram – use the technology from Emu. Backdrop also leverages learnings from our Segment Anything Model.\n\nRestyle lets you reimagine your images by applying the visual styles you describe. Think of typing a descriptor like “watercolor” or a more detailed prompt like “collage from magazines and newspapers, torn edges” to describe the new look and feel of the image you want to create.\n\nBackdrop changes the scene or background of your image. Prompts like “put me in front of a sublime aurora borealis” or “surrounded by puppies” will cue the tool to create an image of the primary subject in the foreground with the background you described.\n\nWe know how important transparency is when it comes to the content AI generates, so images created with restyle and backdrop will indicate the use of AI to reduce the chances of people mistaking them for human-generated content. We’re also experimenting with forms of visible and invisible markers.\n\nWe want these experiences to be safe and trustworthy, while bringing new forms of creativity, entertainment, and expression into your day.\n\nAn Assistant That Spans Our Apps and Devices\n\nMeta AI is a new assistant you can interact with like a person, available on WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram, and coming soon to Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest 3. It’s powered by a custom model that leverages technology from Llama 2 and our latest large language model (LLM) research. In text-based chats, Meta AI has access to real-time information through our search partnership with Bing and offers a tool for image generation.\n\nHere’s an example of how you might use Meta AI:\n\nImagine you and your friends are in a group chat discussing which trailhead to try in Santa Cruz. Meta AI surfaces options directly in the chat, so you can decide as a group which location to explore. What if after the hike you want a creative way to commemorate the day? Meta AI can help. Type “@MetaAI /imagine” followed by a descriptive text prompt like “create a button badge with a hiker and redwood trees,” and it will create a digital merit badge in the chat with your friends.\n\nA Universe of Characters at Your Fingertips\n\nOur journey with AIs is just beginning, and it isn’t purely about building AIs that only answer questions. We’ve been creating AIs that have more personality, opinions, and interests, and are a bit more fun to interact with. Along with Meta AI, there are 28 more AIs that you can message on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. You can think of these AIs as a new cast of characters – all with unique backstories.\n\nAnd because interacting with them should feel like talking to familiar people, we did something to build on this even further. We partnered with cultural icons and influencers to play and embody some of these AIs. They’ll each have profiles on Instagram and Facebook, so you can explore what they’re all about.\n\nCharli D’Amelio as Coco, Dance enthusiast\n\nChris Paul as Perry, Pro golfer helping you perfect your stroke\n\nDwyane Wade as Victor, Ironman triathlete motivating you to be your best self\n\nIzzy Adesanya as Luiz, Showy MMA prospect who can back up his trash talk\n\nKendall Jenner as Billie, No-BS, ride-or-die companion\n\nLaurDIY as Dylan, Quirky DIY and Craft expert and companion for Gen Z\n\nMrBeast as Zach, The big brother who will roast you — because he cares\n\nNaomi Osaka as Tamika, Anime-obsessed Sailor Senshi in training\n\nParis Hilton as Amber, Detective partner for solving whodunnits\n\nRaven Ross as Angie, Workout class queen who balances fitness with meditation\n\nRoy Choi as Max, Seasoned sous chef for culinary tips and tricks\n\nSam Kerr as Sally, Free-spirited friend who’ll tell you when to take a deep breath\n\nSnoop Dogg as Dungeon Master, Adventure awaits, begin your next great story\n\nTom Brady as Bru, Wisecracking sports debater who pulls no punches\n\nWe’re going to start rolling these out in beta in the United States today. We’ll add new characters in the coming weeks played by Bear Grylls, Chloe Kim, and Josh Richards among others.\n\nIt’s still early days for our AIs. Right now, their knowledge base – with the exception of Meta AI, Bru, and Perry – is limited to information that largely existed prior to 2023, which means some responses may be dated. We aim to bring search to many more of our AIs in the coming months – like we have done with Meta AI – so that conversations can be timely and relevant too.\n\nWe are committed to building responsibly with safety in mind. We are continuing to test and evolve the capabilities of our AIs, and will improve the experience over time through what we learn from your interactions with them. Your direct feedback and the conversations you have with our AIs are core parts of what will help us improve our AI models, and ultimately enhance the experience at scale.\n\nWhat’s Coming Next\n\nWe introduced AI studio today, the platform that supports the creation of our AIs and we plan to make it available for people outside of Meta – coders and non-coders alike – to build AIs. Developers will be able to build third-party AIs for our messaging services with our APIs in the coming weeks, starting on Messenger then expanding to WhatsApp.\n\nBusinesses will also be able to create AIs that reflect their brand’s values and improve customer service experiences. From small businesses looking to scale to large brands wanting to enhance communications, AIs can help businesses engage with their customers across our apps. We’re launching this in alpha and will scale it further next year.\n\nAnd for creators, they’ll be able to build AIs that extend their virtual presence across our apps. These AIs will have to be sanctioned by them and directly controlled by the creator.\n\nWe’re also building a sandbox that will be released in the coming year, enabling anyone to experiment with creating their own AI. As our universe of AIs continues to grow and evolve, we’ll bring this sandbox to the metaverse, giving you the chance to build AIs that adopt an even greater level of realism, embodiment, and connectedness.']","For Nvidia, the majority factor is its data center and GPU sales, which increased its stock price significantly in the past year.

"Which company has more risk in chip manufacturing, Nvidia or AMD?","Based on the information gathered, it appears that both Nvidia and AMD are involved in AI chip development, which can be a risky endeavor. However, Nvidia seems to face some downside risks as its customers are developing their own AI chips, potentially impacting Nvidia's market position. On the other hand, AMD is considered a strong competitor in AI chip development, but its valuation is seen as troubling. Therefore, both companies have their own set of risks in chip manufacturing, with Nvidia facing downside risks related to customer developments and AMD facing valuation concerns.

 '(Image credit: Speedrookie/Reddit)\n\nUpdate 4/27/2023, 7:40 am PT: AMD has now issued a second statement clarifying that it has identified the root cause, which is in fact the SoC voltage we identified below in our coverage. AMD has issued new firmware to reduce SoC voltages to 1.3V. You can read the second statement here.\n\nUpdate 4/25/2022, 10:41 am PT: AMD has responded to the numerous reports of chip failures with a short statement acknowledging that claims do exist and that the company is investigating. The statement confirms that AMD is working with its ODM partners (motherboard makers) to ensure safe voltage settings are applied to its Ryzen 7000X3D CPUs, but doesn\'t name the specific actions that it is taking:\n\n\n\n""We are aware of a limited number of reports online claiming that excess voltage while overclocking may have damaged the motherboard socket and pin pads. We are actively investigating the situation and are working with our ODM partners to ensure voltages applied to Ryzen 7000X3D CPUs via motherboard BIOS settings are within product specifications. Anyone whose CPU may have been impacted by this issue should contact AMD customer support."" -- AMD Spokesperson to Tom\'s Hardware.\n\n\n\nNotably, the statement does not acknowledge the multiple reports of failures with standard Ryzen 7000 processors. ASUS has also issued a statement, clarifying that it will issue firmwares that limit SoC voltage to 1.3V. We\'re following up for more detail with AMD and will update as needed. Our original coverage with deeper details about the issues follows:\n\nUpdate #2 4/26/2023 4:00pm PT: Multiple motherboard vendors have now issued press releases pointing to new firmwares they will release in the coming days, with many citing SoC voltage as the adjusted parameter. You can read the vendor statements here.\n\n\n\nOriginal Article 4/24/2022, 9:49 pm PT: Multiple reports of Ryzen processors burning out have burst onto the internet over the last few days. The damaged chips have not only bulged out and overheated to the point they have become desoldered, but they have also done significant damage to the motherboards they are installed in. We reached out to our industry contacts and learned some new information about the nature of the problem and the scope of AMD\'s planned fix. Our information comes from multiple sources that wish to remain anonymous, but the info from our sources aligns on all key technical details. As with all unofficial information, we should take the finer details with a grain of salt until AMD issues an official statement.\n\n\n\nFirst, we\'re told this condition can occur with both standard Ryzen 7000 models and the new Ryzen 7000X3D chips, though the latter is far more sensitive to the condition, and the root cause could be different between the two types of chips. AMD will issue a fix soon, but the timeline is unknown. We\'re told that failures have occurred with all motherboard brands, including Biostar, ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, and ASRock.\n\n\n\nAccording to our sources and seconded by an ASUS statement to Der8auer, the problem stems from SoC voltages being altered to unsafe higher levels. This can be imposed from either the pre-programmed voltages used to support EXPO memory overclocking profiles or when a user manually adjusts the SoC voltages (a common practice to eke out a bit more memory overclocking headroom).\n\n\n\nOur sources also added further details about the nature of the chip failures — in some cases, excessive SoC voltages destroy the chips\' thermal sensors and thermal protection mechanisms, completely disabling its only means of detecting and protecting itself from overheating. As a result, the chip continues to operate without knowing its temperature or tripping the thermal protections.\n\n\n\nAMD\'s modern chips often run at their thermal limits to squeeze out every last drop of performance within their safe thermal range — it isn\'t uncommon for them to run at 95C during normal operation — so they will automatically continue to draw more power until it dials back to remain within a safe temperature. In this case, the lack of temperature sensors and protection mechanisms allows the chip to receive more power beyond the recommended safe limits. This excessive power draw leads to overheating that eventually causes physical damage to the chip, like the bowing we\'ve seen on the outside of several chip packages, or the desoldering reported by Der8auer.\n\nThe chip continues to receive excessive current through the motherboard socket during this death spiral of sorts, thus leading to the visible damage we can see in the socket to the vCore pins and the bulging on the chip\'s LGA pads. However, less visible damage also extends to the CPU SoC, CPU_VDDCR_SOC, and CPU VDD MISC rails/pins — they just don\'t pull enough current to leave visible scorching like we see with the vCore pins.\n\n(Image credit: Enwyi/Reddit)\n\nWe do know that 1.25V is the recommended safe SoC voltage limit, and we\'re told that 1.4V and beyond definitely increases the likelihood of the condition occurring. To be clear, running beyond 1.4V doesn\'t ensure that your chip will burn out, but your odds will increase. Conversely, 1.35V appears to be ""safe."" Proceed at your own risk, though. [EDIT: AMD has issued a statement, clarifying that it will issue firmwares that limit SoC voltage to 1.3V. As such, this appears to be the maximum safe limit.]\n\n\n\nOur sources say that AMD is working on a fix that includes a voltage cap or lock in the firmware/SMU, which should prevent EXPO memory profiles and simple BIOS manipulations from exceeding an as-yet-undefined limit. We\'re also told that AMD can\'t completely prevent SoC voltage manipulations because the amount fed to the chip is dictated by the VRMs, leaving a means for crafty motherboard vendors to allow voltage changes despite AMD\'s lock (this would not be the first time motherboard vendors have circumvented limits to offer rare functionalities).\n\n\n\nA few motherboard vendors, like ASUS and MSI, have already issued new BIOSes to correct some of the issues. However, we have confirmed that failures have also occurred on Biostar, ASRock, and Gigabyte boards, so all vendors are impacted to some degree.\n\n\n\nAs with all forms of overclocking, any damage from using an EXPO overclocking profile is not covered by your warranty, but given the situation, we don\'t think that AMD or the motherboard vendors would use the lack of warrantied EXPO support to invalidate warranties.\n\n(Image credit: LT-Cc/Baidu)\n\nThe advertised performance you get from an EXPO profile is also not guaranteed by the chipmaker. It\'s also noteworthy that AMD\'s purportedly planned SoC voltage cap could lead to lower stable memory overclocking frequencies. However, we don\'t think that will matter too much to most Ryzen 7000 owners, as the sweet spot DDR5-6000 should work just fine within the proposed limits. However, extreme overclockers and those pushing the very bleeding edge of performance could end up with lower overclocking limits. Time will tell.\n\nFor now, you could take a few common sense approaches to potentially protect your chip while we await an official statement from AMD — but proceed at your own risk.\n\n\n\nThis condition means that, even though the odds are small, an EXPO profile could lead to physical damage to your chip and motherboard. If you use an EXPO profile, you should check your SoC voltage in your BIOS or with a utility like HWiNFO. If it is at or exceeds 1.4V, you should disable the profile and run the memory at standard stock settings. If you have manually dialed in a 1.4V or higher SoC voltage, dial that back to a safer setting for now. [EDIT: AMD later confirmed that 1.3V is the maximum safe voltage.]\n\nNow all that is missing is the official word from AMD on the matter. We\'re told the company is moving quickly to resolve the issue, so we expect a statement to arrive soon. We\'ll update as necessary.']","Both companies have certain risks.

How is AMD leveling up their game in the AI chip market to keep up with Nvidia?,"Based on the information gathered, here are some ways AMD is leveling up their game in the AI chip market to compete with Nvidia:

- AMD launched the Ryzen 8000G Series desktop chips in January, specifically targeting AI tasks with heavy workloads.
- The introduction of the MI300X AI GPU represents a significant advancement for AMD as they aim to capture market share currently dominated by Nvidia, especially in competition with Nvidia's H100 chip.
- AMD's strategic focus on cost-effective, advanced compute is aimed at a distinct market segment, potentially different from Nvidia's broad AI ecosystem focus.

These strategies indicate AMD's efforts to enhance their position in the AI chip market and compete more effectively with Nvidia.

PLEASE REVIEW","['This morning is an important one for AMD – perhaps the most important of the year. After almost a year and a half of build-up, and even longer for actual development, AMD is launching their next generation GPU/APU/AI accelerator family, the Instinct MI300 series. Based on AMD\'s new CDNA 3 architecture, and combining it with AMD\'s proven Zen 4 cores, AMD will be making a full-court press for the high-end GPU and accelerator market with their new product, aiming to lead in both big-metal HPC as well as the burgeoning market for generative AI training and inference.\n\nTaking the stage for AMD\'s launch event will be AMD CEO Dr. LIsa Su, as well as a numerous AMD executives and ecosystem partners, to detail, at last, AMD\'s latest generation GPU architecture, and the many forms it will come in. With both the MI300X accelerator and MI300A APU, AMD is aiming to cover most of the accelerator market, whether clients just need a powerful GPU or a tightly-coupled GPU/CPU pairing.\n\nThe stakes for today\'s announcement are significant. The market for generative AI is all but hardware constrained at the moment, much to the benefit of (and profits for) AMD\'s rival NVIDIA. So AMD is hoping to capitalize on this moment to cut off a piece – perhaps a very big piece – of the market for generative AI accelerators. AMD has made breaking into the server space their highest priority over the last half-decade, and now, they believe, is their time to take a big piece of the server GPU market.\n\n12:56PM EST - We\'re here in San Jose for AMD\'s final and most important launch event of the year: Advancing AI\n\n12:57PM EST - Today AMD is making the eagerly anticipated launch of their next-generation MI300 series of accelerators\n\n12:58PM EST - Including MI300A, their first chiplet-based server APU, and MI300X, their stab at the most powerful GPU/accelerator possible for the AI market\n\n12:59PM EST - I\'d say the event is being held in AMD\'s backyard, but since AMD sold their campus here in the bay area several years ago, this is more like NVIDIA\'s backyard. Which is fitting, given that AMD is looking to capture a piece of the highly profitable Generative AI market from NVIDIA\n\n12:59PM EST - We\'re supposed to start at 10am local time here - so in another minute or so\n\n12:59PM EST - And hey, here we go.

 'Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Revenue Recognition Revenue Allowances For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development Arrangements Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. ##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended &#160; Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 27.3 43.1 Gross profit 72.7 56.9 Operating expenses &#160; Research and development 14.2 27.2 Sales, general and administrative 4.4 9.1 Acquisition termination cost &#8212; 5.0 Total operating expenses 18.6 41.3 Operating income 54.1 15.6 Interest income 1.4 1.0 Interest expense (0.4) (1.0) Other, net 0.4 (0.1) Other income (expense), net 1.4 (0.1) Income before income tax 55.5 15.5 Income tax expense (benefit) 6.6 (0.7) Net income 48.9 % 16.2 % ##TABLE_END Reportable Segments Revenue by Reportable Segments ##TABLE_START Year Ended Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Compute &#38; Networking $ 47,405 $ 15,068 $ 32,337 215 % Graphics 13,517 11,906 1,611 14 % Total $ 60,922 $ 26,974 $ 33,948 126 % ##TABLE_END Operating Income by Reportable Segments ##TABLE_START Year Ended Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Compute &#38; Networking $ 32,016 $ 5,083 $ 26,933 530 % Graphics 5,846 4,552 1,294 28 % All Other (4,890) (5,411) 521 (10) % Total $ 32,972 $ 4,224 $ 28,748 681 % ##TABLE_END Compute &#38; Networking revenue &#8211; The year-on-year increase was due to higher Data Center revenue. Compute grew 266% due to higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform for the training and inference of LLMs, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. Networking was up 133% due to higher shipments of InfiniBand. Graphics revenue &#8211; The year-on-year increase was led by growth in Gaming of 15% driven by higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels. Reportable segment operating income &#8211; The year-on-year increase in Compute &#38; Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue. All Other operating loss - The year-on-year decrease was due to the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a $839 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2024.

 'We’re almost done with 2023, and as ever at TechRadar, it’s time to look back at how the various tech giants performed over the past year. In AMD’s case, we saw some inspiring new products introduced for its consumer processor and GPU ranges, and renewed gusto in its pursuit of AI.\n\nThere were also shakier times for Team Red, though, notably a string of blunders – the vapor chamber cooling debacle is one that springs immediately to mind, but there were other incidents, and a few too many of them. Join us as we explore the ups and downs of AMD’s 2023, weighing everything up at the end.\n\n(Image credit: Future/John Loeffler)\n\nZen 4 gets 3D V-Cache\n\nOne of AMD’s big moves this year was the introduction of 3D V-Cache for AMD’s Ryzen 7000 desktop processors.\n\nThere were a trio of X3D models introduced, with the higher-end Ryzen 9 7950X3D and 7900X3D hitting the shelves first in February. These were good CPUs and we liked them, particularly the Ryzen 9 7950X3D, which is a sterling processor, albeit very pricey (similarly, we felt the price of the 7900X3D held it back somewhat).\n\nWhat everyone was really waiting for, though, was the more affordable mid-range 3D V-Cache chip, and the Ryzen 7 7800X3D turned up in April. We praised the 7800X3D’s outstanding gaming performance and it’s the best choice for a gaming PC as we conclude in our roundup of the best processors. This was a definite highlight in AMD’s releases this year.\n\nWe were also treated to an interesting diversion in the form of a new last-gen X3D processor which AMD chose a very different tactic for. The Ryzen 5 5600X3D arrived in July as a cheap CPU that’s great for an affordable gaming PC, the catch being that it only went on sale through Micro Center stores in the US. For those who couldn’t get that, though, there was always the old Ryzen 5800X3D which dipped to some really low price tags at various points throughout the year. For gamers, AMD had some tempting pricing, that’s for sure.\n\nAway from the world of 3D V-Cache, AMD also pushed out a few vanilla Ryzen 7000 CPUs right at the start of the year, namely the Ryzen 9 7900, Ryzen 7 7700, and Ryzen 5 7600, the siblings of the already released ‘X’ versions of these processors. They were useful choices to be thrown into the mix offering a bit more affordability for the Zen 4 range.\n\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nRDNA 3 arrives for real\n\nAMD unleashed its RDNA 3 graphics cards right at the close of 2022, but only the top-tier models, the Radeon RX 7900 series. And the RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT were all we had until 2023 was surprisingly far along – it wasn’t until May that the RX 7600 pitched up at the other end of the GPU spectrum.\n\nThe RX 7600 very much did its job as a wallet-friendly graphics card, mind you, and this GPU seriously impressed us with its outstanding performance at 1080p and excellent value proposition overall. Indeed, the RX 7600 claimed the title of our best cheap graphics card for this year, quite an achievement, beating out Nvidia’s RTX 4060.\n\nThen we had another sizeable pause – which witnessed gamers getting rather impatient – for the gap, or rather gulf, to be filled in between the RX 7600 and RX 7900 models. Enter stage left the RX 7800 XT and the 7700 XT as mid-range contenders in September, one of which really punched its weight.\n\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nThat was the RX 7800 XT and even though it only marginally outdid its predecessor for pure performance, this new RDNA 3 mid-ranger did so well in terms of its price/performance ratio versus its RTX 4070 rival that the AMD GPU scooped the coveted top spot in our best graphics card roundup. (Deposing the RTX 4070, in fact, which had held the number one position since its release six months prior).\n\nAs for the RX 7700 XT, that was rather overshadowed by its bigger mid-range sibling here, not making as much sense value-wise as the 7800 XT.\n\nStill, the long and short of it is that AMD bagged both the title of the best GPU for this year, as well as the best budget offering – not too shabby indeed.\n\nFrom what we saw of sales reports – anecdotally and via the rumor mill – these new desktop graphics cards pepped up AMD’s sales a good deal. While the RX 7900 series GPUs were struggling against Nvidia early in 2023, towards the end of the year, the 7800 XT in particular was really shifting a lot of units (more than the RTX 4070).\n\nWhile Nvidia is still the dominant desktop GPU power by far, it’s a sure bet AMD regained some turf with these popular RDNA 3 launches in 2023.\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nFSR 3 finally turns up\n\nWe did a fair bit of waiting for stuff from AMD this year as already observed, and another item to add to the list where patience was definitely required was FSR 3.\n\nFSR is, of course, AMD’s rival to DLSS for boosting frame rates in games, and more specifically, FSR 3 was Team Red’s response to DLSS 3 that uses frame generation technology (inserting extra frames into the game to artificially boost the frame rate).\n\nFSR 3 was actually announced in November 2022 – as we covered in our roundup of AMD’s highlights for last year – and we predicted back then that it wouldn’t turn up for ages.\n\nIndeed, it didn’t, and we heard nothing about FSR 3, save for a small info drop for game developers in March, for most of 2023. Then finally, at the end of September, AMD officially released FSR 3.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t a simple case of that’s that and AMD was level-pegging with Nvidia suddenly. For starters, Nvidia went ahead and pushed out DLSS 3.5 (featuring ray reconstruction), and frankly, AMD’s frame generation feature was quite some way behind Team Green’s in its initial incarnation. It was also not nearly as widely supported – and remains so – with adoption moving at a sluggish pace, and only four games available that make use of FSR 3 so far.\n\nBut at least it’s here, and AMD made another important move in December, as the year drew to a close, releasing an improved version of FSR 3. We saw with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – the third game to introduce support – that the new version of FSR (3.0.3) runs a good deal more slickly, at least according to some reports.\n\n(Image credit: AMD / Ubisoft)\n\nOn top of this, AMD also made FSR 3 open source. That means more games should be supported soon enough (and modders can, and already have, started introducing FSR 3 to some titles, but unofficial support will never be quite the same as the developer implementing the tech).\n\nFurthermore, in terms of better support for games, Team Red did make another move at the same time as FSR 3. We’re talking about AMD’s Fluid Motion Frame (AFMF) tech which as well as being part of FSR 3 is integrated separately at a driver level.\n\nThis allows for frame generation boosts to be applied to all games – via the driver, with no need for the game to be coded to support it – with the caveat being that it only works with RX 7000 and 6000 GPUs. Now that’s great, but note that what you’re getting here is a ‘lite’ version of the frame generation process applied in FSR.\n\nAs 2023 now comes to a close, AFMF is still in preview (testing) and somewhat wonky, though Team Red has improved the tech a fair bit since launch, much like FSR 3.\n\nIn short, it looks like AMD is getting there, and also ushering in innovations such as anti-lag+ (for reducing input latency, with RX 7000 and supported games only, although this has had its own issues). Not to mention the company is wrapping up all this tech in HYPR-RX, an easy-to-use one-click tuning mode that’ll apply relevant (supported) features to make a given game perform optimally (hopefully).\n\nBut there’s still that inevitable feeling of following in Nvidia’s wake when it comes to FSR and related features, with AMD rather struggling to keep up with the good ship Jensen.\n\nStill, AMD appears to have an overarching vision it’s making solid, if somewhat slow, progress towards, but we certainly need to see more games that (officially) support FSR 3 – with an implementation impressive enough to equal DLSS 3 (or get close to it).\n\n(Image credit: Future)\n\nPortable goodness\n\nThis year saw some interesting launches from AMD on the portable device front, not the least of which was the Ryzen Z1 APU. Built on Zen 4, this mobile processor emerged in April to be the engine that several gaming handhelds were built around, notably the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go.\n\nThere were two versions of the Z1, the 6-core vanilla chip, and a Z1 Extreme variant which was an 8-core CPU but crucially had a lot more graphics grunt (12 RDNA 3 CUs, rather than just 4 CUs for the baseline processor). The Z1 Extreme proved to be an immense boon to these Windows-powered gaming handhelds, driving the Legion Go to become what we called the true Steam Deck rival in our review.\n\nThe weakness of those Windows-toting Steam Deck rivals is, of course, the battery life trade-off (particularly when driving demanding games at more taxing settings). AMD was on hand to help here, too, introducing HYPR-RX Eco profiles to its graphics driver late in the year, which should offer a convenient way to tap into considerable power-savings (without too much performance trade-off – we hope).\n\nAway from handhelds, in December we were also treated to the launch of a range of Ryzen 8000 CPUs for laptops. These ‘Hawk Point’ chips aren’t out yet, but will debut in notebooks in early 2024, although note that they’re Zen 4-based (the same as Ryzen 7000 silicon).\n\nThe line-up is led by the flagship Ryzen 9 8945HS, an 8-core processor with integrated graphics (Radeon 780M) that’ll be great for 1080p gaming (with some details toned down, mind). These chips will also benefit from AMD’s XDNA NPU (Neural Processing Unit) for accelerating AI tasks, and Team Red asserted that Hawk Point chips will be 1.4x faster than the Ryzen 7040 series in generative AI workloads – a pretty tasty upgrade.\n\n(Image credit: AMD)\n\nAI bandwagon\n\nThose Hawk Point mobile CPUs showed AMD’s growing focus on AI, and this was a broader push for Team Red throughout the year, which comes as no surprise – everyone who was anyone in tech, after all, was investing in artificial intelligence. Moreover, Nvidia made an absolute fortune in the AI space this year, and obviously that didn’t go unnoticed at AMD towers.\n\nAs well as incorporating heftier NPUs in its processors, in May AMD tapped Microsoft for resources and cash to help develop AI chips (for the gain of both companies). But the real power move for Team Red came late in the year, when in December AMD revealed a Zen 4 APU for AI applications (the largest chip it has ever made, in fact, bristling with 153 billion transistors).\n\nThe Instinct MI300A is loaded with 24 CPU cores plus a GPU with 228 CDNA 3 CUs and eight stacks of HBM3 memory, posing a genuine threat to Nvidia’s AI dominance. AMD’s testing indicates that the MI300A is about on par with Nvidia’s mighty H100 for AI performance, and as the year ended, we heard that firms like Microsoft and Meta are interested in adopting the tech.\n\nAMD said that the Instinct MI300A will be priced competitively to poach customers from Nvidia, as you might expect, while acknowledging that Team Green will of course remain dominant in this space in the near future. However, Lisa Su intends for her firm to take a “nice piece” of a huge AI market going forward, and if the MI300A is anything to go by, we don’t doubt it.\n\n(Image credit: Reshetnikov_art / Shutterstock)\n\nYear of the gremlins\n\nWhile AMD had plenty of success stories in 2023, as we’ve seen, there were also lots of things that went wrong. Little things, medium-sized things, and great hulking gremlins crawling around in the works and making life difficult – or even miserable – for the owners of some AMD products who got unlucky.\n\nIndeed, AMD was dogged by lots of issues early in the year, most notably a serious misstep with the cooling (vapor chamber) for RX 7900 XTX graphics cards. Although the flaw only affected a small percentage of reference boards, it’s absolutely one of the biggest GPU blunders we can recall in recent years. (Nvidia’s melting cables with the RTX 4090 being another obvious one).\n\nWe also witnessed a worrying flaw with AMD’s Ryzen 7000 CPUs randomly burning out in certain overclocking scenarios. Ouch, in a word.\n\nOther examples of AMD’s woes this year include a graphics driver update in March bricking Windows installations (admittedly in rare cases, but still, this is a nasty thing to happen off the back of a simple Adrenalin driver update), and other driver bugs besides (causing freezing or crashing). And we also saw AMD chips that had security flaws of one kind or another, some more worrying than others.\n\nNot to mention RX 7000 graphics cards consuming far too much power when idling in some PC setups (multiple monitors, or high refresh rate screens – a problem not resolved until near the end of the year, in fact).\n\nThere were other hitches besides, but you get the idea – 2023 was a less than ideal time for AMD in terms of gaffes and failures of various natures.\n\n(Image credit: Future / John Loeffler)\n\nConcluding thoughts\n\nClearly, AMD tried the patience of gamers in some respects this year. First of all with those glaring assorted blunders which doubtless proved a source of frustration for some owners of their products. And secondly, purely due to making gamers wait an excessively lengthy time for features like FSR 3 – which seemed to take an age to come through – and ditto for filling out the rest of the RDNA 3 range, as those graphics cards took quite some time to arrive.\n\nHowever, the latter were very much worth the wait. The double whammy for GPUs was a real coup for AMD, releasing the top budget graphics card in the RX 7600, and our favorite GPU of them all, the reigning RX 7800 XT that sits atop our ranking of the top boards available right now.\n\nThere were plenty of other highlights, such as releasing the best gaming CPU ever made – in the form of the Ryzen 7 7800X3D – which was a pretty sharp move this year. We also received a top-notch mobile APU for handhelds in the Ryzen Z1 Extreme.\n\nAMD’s GPU sales were appropriately stoked as 2023 rolled on, and FSR – plus other related game boosting tech – seems to be coming together finally, albeit in an overly slow but steady manner as mentioned. In the field of AI, Team Red is suitably ramping up its CPUs, and with the Instinct MI300A accelerator it’s providing a meaningful challenge to Nvidia’s dominance.\n\nIn short, despite some worrying wobbles, 2023 was a good year for AMD. The future looks pretty rosy, too, certainly with next-gen Zen 5 processors that look set to get the drop on Intel’s Arrow Lake silicon next year. And some even more tantalizing Zen 5 laptop chips (‘Strix Point’ – sitting above Hawk Point, and sporting XDNA 2 and RDNA 3.5) are inbound for 2024.\n\nNext-gen Radeon GPUs are a little sketchier – RDNA 4 is coming next year, but the range may top out at mid-tier products, as AMD refocuses more on AI graphics cards (as expected in terms of going where the profits are). Those RDNA 4 cards could still pack a value punch, though, and looking at the current mid-range champ, the RX 7800 XT, we’d be shocked if they didn’t.'

 ""Back at CES 2023, AMD announced the first wave of Ryzen Mobile parts based on its Zen 4 architecture, the Ryzen Mobile 7040HS series. Based on AMD's Phoenix silicon, which uses TSMC's 4 nm process node to mix Zen 4 CPU cores with AMD's RDNA 3 graphics compute units all in a single, monolithic die, Phoenix is the next generation of high efficiency, highly-integrated AMD silicon. And today, AMD is revealing that Phoenix is going to spread its wings a little farther, with the announcement of the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series for ultraportable notebooks.\n\nBringing AMD's latest generation technologies down to the thin and light laptop market, the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series follows AMD's traditional cascading launch mobile launch strategy, delivering new silicon into increasingly lower powered devices as chip production ramps up and OEMs finish putting together new designs. Whereas the original 7040HS series is aimed at higher-power, higher performing laptops, the 7040U series tunes the same same silicon for more modest TDPs in the 15 Watt to 30 Watt range, making it better suited for use in ultraportable thin and light laptops – and fully exploiting the efficiency advantages of Zen 4.\n\nWe've been expecting the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series for quite some time now – AMD made it clear as far back as CES that a traditional U-series lineup was in the works, but until now we just didn't know when to expect it. Though considering that you still can't buy a 7040HS laptop today, today's 7040U announcement from AMD should not be taken as a sign that 7040U laptops are going to be on retail shelves any time in the immediate future.\n\nAMD Ryzen 7040U Series: Up to 8-Cores With RDNA 3 Graphics\n\nAMD's Ryzen Mobile 7040 series spans multiple key mobile product categories, ranging from the entry-level, which AMD segments as 'everyday computing' to its 'extreme gaming and creator' lineup for high-end and powerful gaming laptops. At the bottom of AMD's Pheonix Point series for mobile, the new AMD Ryzen Mobile 7040U series is comprised of four SKUs, which range from 8-core parts down to 4-cores; all of which include AMD's RDNA 3 integrated graphics. Phoenix also introduces AMD's Ryzen AI technology, an FPGA-based AI engine developed by Xilinx, which AMD claims are the first AI processor of its kind and is designed to accelerate AI workloads.\n\nAs they announced at CES 2023, AMD has updated its mobile naming scheme to make it somewhat easier for users to decipher what all the digits and characters in the product name mean. For the Ryzen Mobile 7040U series, the first digit represents the model year, with 7 being used for 2023, while the second digit represents the market segment, e.g., Ryzen 7 = 7, Ryzen 5 = 5/6, and Ryzen 3 = 3/4. The third digit (4) represents the CPU architecture of the product, so in the case of the 7040, it uses its latest Zen 4 cores.\n\nThe last character (suffix) is perhaps the most important indicator of the market segment, as it relates to the TDP and form factor, as the U relates to being a 15-30 W part. For those of you playing at home, this is a slight increase in the TDP window over previous generations – where the U series was 15-28 W – though with laptop vendors able to set their TDPs wherever they like, official TDPs are more of loose guidelines these days anyhow.\n\nAMD Ryzen 7040U Mobile CPUs (Phoenix 4nm) AnandTech C/T Base\n\nFreq (MHz) Turbo\n\nFreq\n\n(MHz) iGPU iGPU CUs iGPU Freq L3 Cache\n\n(MB) TDP Ryzen 7 7840U 8/16 3300 5100 Radeon 780M 12 Up to 2.7 GHz 16 15-30W Ryzen 5 7640U 6/12 3500 4900 Radeon 760M 8 Up to 2.6 GHz 16 15-30W Ryzen 5 7540U 6/12 3200 4900 Radeon 740M 4 Up to 2.5 GHz 16 15-30W Ryzen 3 7440U 4/8 3000 4700 Radeon 740M 4 Up to 2.5 GHz 8 15-30W\n\nLooking at the four Ryzen 7040U SKUs for thin and light AMD-based notebooks, all four of its 'Pheonix' based APUs include AMD's RDNA 3 Radeon 700M series integrated graphics. Starting with the premier model, the Ryzen 7 7840U is an 8C/16T part with a base frequency of 3.3 GHz and a turbo frequency of up to 5.1 GHz. It has a combined total cache of 24 MB, with 16 MB of L3 cache for the entire chip and 1 MB of L2 cache per core, for a total of 8 MB of L2 cache.\n\nMoving down the stack is a pair of Ryzen 5 models, the Ryzen 5 7640U and Ryzen 7540U, both of which include 6 CPU cores. The Ryzen 5 7640U is the faster of the two chips, with a 300 MHz bump on CPU base frequency over the 7540U (3.5 v.s 3.2 GHz), though both APUs have a turbo frequency of up to 4.9 GHz. Curiously, AMD is also using this point as the dividing line between what parts do or do not get the Ryzen AI co-processor; the upper-tier 7640U comes with it, but the lower-tier 7540U does not. Past that, the Ryzen 5 7640U and Ryzen 5 7540U are 6-core parts, so they have 16 MB of L3 cache and 6 MB of L2 cache.\n\nAs these are Ryzen 5 mobile Zen 4 APUs, they include AMD's Radeon 700M graphics. The Ryzen 5 7640U has the better iGPU of the two, with the Radeon 760M with 8 CUs with a maximum frequency of up to 2.6 GHz. In comparison, the Ryzen 5 7540U has the lower spec Radeon 740M with 4 CUs, although both iGPUs feature the same 16 ROPs/2 RB+ blocks.\n\nThe entry-level option to AMD's Zen 4 7040U series chips is the Ryzen 3 7440U, which is a quad-core APU (4C/8T) with a base frequency of 3.0 GHz, a turbo frequency of up to 4.7 GHz. This part also includes the Radeon 740M (4 CU) integrated graphics. As this is a 4-core part, AMD has significantly reduced the amount of available cache, for a combined total of 12 MB that's split into 8 MB of L3 cache and 4 MB of L2 cache.\n\n\n\nBlock diagram of the AMD Radeon 780M integrated graphics\n\nIt's worth pointing out that the Radeon 780M with 12 compute units (CU) has four Render Backends (RB+) blocks within the silicon, while both the Radeon 760M (8 CU) and Radeon 740M (4 CU) feature just two RB+ blocks. Compared to the Ryzen Mobile 6000 series, AMD has also improved the graphics frequencies, with the Radeon 780M clocking up to 2.7 GHz, which is 300 MHz faster than the Radeon 680M, which hit up to 2.4 GHz.\n\nAMD Ryzen 7040U With Ryzen AI: One Xilinx XDNA Block Included\n\nAMD's acquisition of Xilinx, which closed in February of last year, means they have been able to feed Xilinx's expertise and architecture into its latest Zen 4 products. The most prominent example is what AMD calls Ryzen AI, which is part of Xilinx's XDNA architecture. This XDNA-based architecture has been enabled within two of the four Ryzen 7040U series SKUs, with the top two SKUs, the Ryzen 7 7840U and Ryzen 5 7640U, getting access to the Ryzen AI block integrated into the silicon. The inclusion of 'Ryzen AI' is to bolster the capability of AMD's Phoenix processors in AI inference workloads, offering more efficient task-specific silicon than what the CPU or GPU are capable of.\n\nAnother interesting highlight of AMD Ryzen AI is that it directly supports Microsoft's Studio Effects pack within Windows 11, which AMD claims can only be enabled by a dedicated engine like AMD Ryzen AI. While an interesting inclusion to the silicon for AI workloads, AMD hasn't provided or published any expected performance figures to accompany the announcement.\n\nWhile we typically take a robust stance in digesting in-house performance figures, we usually don't take these at face value with in-house benchmarks optimizing things for favorable results. AMD did, however, provide some compute, and gaming performance figures comparing the performance of the Ryzen 7 7840U to Intel's Core i7-1360P and compute performance against Apple's M2 silicon.\n\nAMD is claiming up to 175% gains in Passmark 10 performance over Apple's M2 chip while offering up to 228% Media Encode performance over the Core i7-1360P; these are undoubtedly best-case figures and are to be taken with a pinch of salt. Interestingly in the gaming performance figures, which it put up its Ryzen 7 7840U with Radeon 780M integrated graphics again Intel's Core i7-1360P with Iris Xe graphics, it's not too surprising to see that the Radeon 780M performed between 130% and 239% better than Intel in specific titles. If nothing else, AMD typically invests in more GPU silicon for their high-end mobile processors.\n\nRegarding battery life, AMD states that it has heavily invested in efficiency leadership designed to bolster battery life by implementing Smart Power Management. As with previous announcements of its 7040HS series, AMD has yet to indicate how long battery life might be. Still, as partners and notebook vendors start to integrate Ryzen 7040U APUs with Zen 4 into their solutions, we'll eventually see how efficient AMD's Ryzen Mobile 7040U 15-30 W chips are compared to the previous generation.\n\nRyzen 7040U Launch: No Date as of Yet, But Expected Very Soon\n\nOne of the most significant talking points surrounding AMD's Ryzen 7040 mobile series is when they will launch. Early indications from AMD stated that we should start seeing broader adoption of its 7040 chips sometime in March. AMD announced to us in mid-March that it had pushed back the launch of its Ryzen Mobile 7040HS series until April.\n\nAs for the AMD Ryzen Mobile 7040U series, AMD isn't announcing any kind of release date or expected availability date at this time. Given the timing of AMD's announcement – a few weeks before Computex – we expect we'll find out more about the specific laptops in development and their expected release dates at that show.""]","AMD is launching more affordable chip with similar performance compare to Nvidia's GPU.

 'Item 7. Management\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221;, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. Overview Our Company and Our Businesses NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for accelerated computing, AI solutions, scientific computing, data science, AV, robotics, metaverse and 3D internet applications. Our two operating segments are ""Compute &#38; Networking"" and ""Graphics."" Refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges Demand and Supply, Product Transitions, and New Products and Business Models Demand for our data center systems and products surged in fiscal year 2024. Entering fiscal year 2025, we are gathering customer demand indications across several product transitions. We have demand visibility for our new data center products ramping later in fiscal year 2025. We have increased our supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. These increased purchase volumes, the number of suppliers, and the integration of new vendors into our supply chain may create more complexity and execution risk. Our purchase commitments and obligations for inventory and manufacturing capacity at the end of fiscal year 2024 were impacted by shortening lead times for certain components. We may continue to enter into new supplier and capacity arrangements. Supply of Hopper architecture products is improving, and demand remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply-constrained based upon demand indications. We may incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines. We build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand. While we have entered into long-term supply and capacity commitments, we may not be able to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address our business needs, or our long-term demand expectations may change. These risks may increase as we shorten our product development cycles, enter new lines of business, or integrate new suppliers or components into our supply chain, creating additional supply chain complexity. Product transitions are complex as we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously and we and our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. Due to our product introduction cycles, we are almost always in various stages of transitioning the architecture of our Data Center, Professional Visualization, and Gaming products. We will have a broader and faster Data Center product launch cadence to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. The increased frequency of these transitions may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand due to manufacturing lead times. Qualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can create reductions or volatility in our revenue. The increasing frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty or other costs or result in product delays. Deployment of new products to customers creates additional challenges due to the complexity of our technologies, which has impacted and may in the future impact the timing of customer purchases or otherwise impact our demand. While we have managed prior product transitions and have previously sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and we may incur additional costs. We build technology and introduce products for new and innovative use cases and applications such as our NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, Omniverse platform, LLMs, and generative AI models. Our demand estimates for new use cases, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels, and we may not be able to generate significant revenue from these use cases, applications, and services. Recent technologies, such as generative AI models, have emerged, and while they have driven increased demand for Data Center, the long-term trajectory is unknown. Global Trade During the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. In July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East. In October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance thresholds, including A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23, 2023, the USG informed us the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products. Our sales to China decreased as a percentage of total Data Center revenue from 19% in fiscal year 2023 to 14% in fiscal year 2024. '
 ""federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results. The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Table of Contents Our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split, changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in the United States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business. Over the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. As of July 2023, nearly 140 countries have approved a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business. The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations. Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements. Given our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate has in the past varied, and may in the future vary, significantly depending on our stock price. The tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation have in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, our effective tax rate, sometimes significantly, from period to period. In periods in which our stock price varies from the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2023, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $708 million and our effective income tax rate by one percentage point as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price varies in comparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate.

 'In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.\n\nWith such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\n\nAt a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P/S. Thus, it looks much more reasonably valued than NVIDIA, especially considering its five-year mean P/S of eight. However, a neutral view might be appropriate in the near term due to the geopolitical overhang for Taiwanese stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enjoyed a nice 11% lift over the last five days due to NVIDIA’s good news, enjoying their best week in almost a year. TSM is likely to see some sales increase from the AI transition because it manufactures NVIDIA’s chips, but any impact is likely to be modest.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could face issues amid the growing tensions between Taiwan and China, which convinced Warren Buffett to dump most of his $4.1 billion stake after less than a year. Given Buffett’s long-term focus, it’s highly unusual that he would sell the position after holding it for such a short time.\n\nThus, while Taiwan Semiconductor could end up being an excellent long-term investment at current prices, the recent rally paired with the geopolitical tensions suggests a neutral view for now.\n\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sells assigned over the last three months. At $118.67, the average Taiwan Semiconductor stock price target implies upside potential of 19.93%.\n\nConclusion: Bearish on NVDA, Neutral on TSM\n\nNVIDIA and TSM clearly have excellent long-term prospects, given their AI exposure. However, it seems like buying NVIDIA shares at current prices could be playing with fire, given its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price.\n\nTSM’s valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI, but the geopolitical overhang adds significant risk to owning the shares.\n\nDisclosure'
 'Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) took a beating Thursday as the world\'s largest contract chipmaker topped analyst estimates for the second quarter but disappointed with its outlook. TSM stock fell more than 5% and dragged other chip players down with it.\n\nX\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, better known as TSMC, earned $1.14 per U.S. share on sales of $15.68 billion in the June quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of $1.07 a share on sales of $15.44 billion. However, TSMC earnings fell 25% year over year while sales dropped 12%. In local currency, earnings decreased 23% while sales declined 10%.\n\nTSMC\'s results marked its second straight quarter of declining sales and earnings as its customers navigate a downturn in chip demand.\n\nFor the current quarter, TSMC predicted revenue of $16.7 billion to $17.5 billion. The midpoint of $17.1 billion is below Wall Street\'s target of $17.4 billion. In the year-earlier period, TSMC generated $19.2 billion in sales.\n\nTSM Stock Falls After Report\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor also cut its revenue forecast for the full year to a 10% decline from a mid-single-digit decline.\n\n""This is the third cut to its revenue outlook that TSMC has made this cycle,"" Needham analyst Charles Shi said in a note to clients. Shi had expected TSMC to reduce its 2023 sales outlook to a high-single-digit decline.\n\n""TSMC\'s second-quarter earnings call may go down as one of the more pessimistic calls in recent history,"" Shi said.\n\nOn the stock market today, TSM stock tumbled 5.1% to close at 97.86.\n\nTSMC\'s earnings report pulled down a host of semiconductor stocks. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, known as SOX, sank 3.6% on Thursday. The SOX includes the 30 largest semiconductor stocks traded in the U.S.\n\nAmong major TSMC customers, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 5.3% and Nvidia (NVDA) retreated 3.3%.\n\nTSM stock is in a flat base with a buy point of 110.69, according to IBD MarketSmith charts.\n\nFactors Behind Soft Demand\n\n""Our second-quarter business was impacted by the overall global economic conditions, which dampened the end-market demand, and led to customers\' ongoing inventory adjustment,"" Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said in a news release.\n\nHe added, ""Moving into third quarter 2023, we expect our business to be supported by the strong ramp of our 3-nanomenter technologies, partially offset by customers\' continued inventory adjustment.""\n\nCircuit widths on chips are measured in nanometers, which are one-billionth of a meter.\n\nThe slower-than-expected economic recovery in China also is a factor in TSMC\'s reduced outlook, Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said in a report.\n\nIn addition, the chip inventory correction now is likely to last through the fourth quarter, rather than the third quarter as previously expected, Muse said.\n\nTaiwan Semi Getting AI Boost\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor produces chips for fabless semiconductor firms such as AMD, Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM).\n\nCyclical headwinds overshadowed strength in AI chip production at TSMC in the second quarter, Needham\'s Shi said.\n\nTSMC management expects chips for artificial intelligence to grow to a low-teens percent of sales by 2028 from 6% today.\n\n""Management still sees Q3 as the end of an inventory correction but believes customers may not build inventory back as fast as previously expected,"" Shi said.\n\nTSM Stock On Tech Leaders List\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Matt Bryson kept his outperform rating on TSM stock despite the company\'s disappointing outlook.\n\n""While we believe this deterioration in outlook wasn\'t unexpected, the magnitude of the downtick was more significant than we had anticipated heading into earnings,"" Bryson said in a note to clients.\n\nTSM stock ranks sixth out of 30 stocks in IBD\'s semiconductor manufacturing industry group, according to IBD Stock Checkup. Taiwan Semiconductor has an IBD Composite Rating of 92 out of 99. IBD\'s Composite Rating is a blend of key fundamental and technical metrics to help investors gauge a stock\'s strengths.

"Compare AMD to Nvidia, which company should I invest more?","Based on the information gathered, here are some points to consider when comparing AMD to Nvidia for investment:

- AMD's balance sheet strength is highlighted as a positive factor for potential investments.
- Nvidia and AMD have been mentioned in relation to AI chip demand, with both companies rebounding after a drop in stock prices.
- Nvidia has been navigating a U.S. embargo by securing chips through third-party vendors for Chinese firms.
- AMD investors are expecting to hear more about the company's AI ambitions.

Considering the points above, both AMD and Nvidia have their strengths and opportunities in the market. It is essential to conduct further research and analysis on both companies to make an informed investment decision based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and market outlook.

PLEASE REVIEW","['In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. A deeper analysis suggests a bullish view for NVIDIA and a bearish view for AMD.\n\nNVIDIA develops graphics processing units (GPUs) semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI), gaming, creative design, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, AMD designs processors and related technologies for AI, data centers, gaming, and business-computing applications.\n\nShares of NVDA are up 240% year-to-date. Meanwhile, AMD stock has gained 93% year-to-date, including a 20% return over the last three months.\n\nDespite NVIDIA’s much higher gains this year, it’s trading at a much lower valuation than AMD. We’ll look at their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is currently trading at a P/E of 46.4 versus its three-year average P/E of 29.9.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of around 64.3, NVIDIA is trading at a relatively small premium to its industry (compared to AMD’s premium anyway). In fact, the stock hasn’t been this cheap in a year, and its long-term gains also suggest a bullish view might be appropriate despite the tremendous year-to-date gain.\n\nOn a P/E basis, NVIDIA hasn’t been this cheap since December 2022. In fact, NVIDIA was trading at a P/E of over 100 just days ago — before the last earnings report. Of course, significantly higher earnings send a company’s P/E much lower if its stock price doesn’t change dramatically.\n\nIn NVIDIA’s case, its earnings exploded so much higher year-over-year that its P/E was cut nearly in half after just a small pullback from around $500 a share on November 22 to $489 on November 24. For its third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.02 per share on $18.1 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of $3.37 per share on $16.2 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a comparative basis, NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, while its adjusted earnings rose nearly sevenfold year-over-year and 49% quarter-over-quarter. The chipmaker’s GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings rose more than 13 times from a year ago to $3.71 per share, also demonstrating exploding growth.\n\nBefore that earnings report, NVIDIA shares had soared to a record high of around $505 with a P/E of about 120 in November. Normally, I wouldn’t suggest a bullish view of a stock that has risen so much, so fast.\n\nHowever, once the market recognizes its lower valuation — and recovers from management’s warning about significantly lower sales to China and other countries due to export restrictions — NVIDIA shares will likely continue their tear. Despite that warning, the chipmaker still guided for almost 231% revenue growth to $20 billion in the fourth quarter, so it clearly isn’t all that worried.\n\nEven if the stock doesn’t recover dramatically in the near term, NVIDIA’s long-term stock-price gains of 267% over the last three years, 1,184% over the last five, and 13,066% over the last 10 provide some level of safety over the long term. In fact, I would use any near-term pullbacks to add to the position.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $660.39, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies upside potential of 36.7%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAt a P/E of 1,120, Advanced Micro Devices has the opposite problem of NVIDIA. Its valuation has skyrocketed because it’s now barely profitable. However, the chipmaker certainly isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so it’s only a matter of time before it bounces back. For now, though, a bearish view seems appropriate, pending a better entry price or improved earnings numbers.\n\nIn the third quarter, AMD reported $299 million in GAAP net income, although that was an improvement from net income of $66 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company’s net income rose 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. AMD also reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the quarter, up from $5.6 billion a year ago.\n\nUnfortunately, AMD continues to play catch-up to NVIDIA in the area of artificial intelligence, although management did reveal some progress on its last earnings call, announcing improvements in the company’s AI software capabilities through R&D and acquisitions. Management also expects the MI300 data center chip, which will support AI models, to be “the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.” In short, AMD will likely catch up to NVIDIA at some point, but we’re not there yet.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for AMD Stock?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $126.79, the average AMD stock price target implies upside potential of 2.9%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on NVDA, Bearish on AMD\n\nThe battle between NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices has been going on for years, with one company pulling out in front of the other and then the other catching up and trading places. Nonetheless, neither of these companies is going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nHowever, AMD could be playing catch-up to NVIDIA on AI for some time, calling for a wait-and-see approach. Meanwhile, NVIDIA will likely rerate higher once the market digests management’s warning about the new export restrictions.\n\nDisclosure'
 'Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Revenue Recognition Revenue Allowances For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development Arrangements Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share.

 'Item 1A. Risk Factors The following risk factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation. Risk Factors Summary Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets &#8226; Failure to meet the evolving needs of our industry may adversely impact our financial results. &#8226; Competition could adversely impact our market share and financial results. Risks Related to Demand, Supply and Manufacturing &#8226; Failure to estimate customer demand accurately has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand. &#8226; Dependency on third-party suppliers and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test, or package our products reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, and product delivery schedules and could harm our business. &#8226; Defects in our products have caused and could cause us to incur significant expenses to remediate and could damage our business. Risks Related to Our Global Operating Business &#8226; Adverse economic conditions may harm our business. &#8226; International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business. &#8226; Product, system security and data breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition, stock price and reputation. &#8226; Business disruptions could harm our operations and financial results. &#8226; Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business. &#8226; We may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, nor successfully integrate acquisition targets. &#8226; A significant amount of our revenue stems from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to end customers, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these end customers. &#8226; We may be unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. &#8226; Modification or interruption of our business processes and information systems may disrupt our business, and internal controls. &#8226; Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline. Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters &#8226; We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations, and political and other actions, which may adversely impact our business. &#8226; Increased scrutiny from shareholders, regulators, and others regarding our corporate sustainability practices could result in financial, reputational, or operational harm and liability. &#8226; Issues relating to the responsible use of our technologies, including AI, may result in reputational or financial harm and liability. &#8226; Adequately protecting our IP rights could be costly, and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products. &#8226; We are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, and other obligations. These areas could damage our reputation, deter customers, affect product design, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings and liability. &#8226; Our operating results may be adversely impacted by additional tax liabilities, higher than expected tax rates, changes in tax laws, and other tax-related factors. &#8226; Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations, and regulatory proceedings. &#8226; Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows from operations and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. &#8226; Delaware law, provisions in our governing documents and our agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control. Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets Failure to meet the evolving needs of our industry and markets may adversely impact our financial results. Our accelerated computing platforms experience rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, competitive products, and industry standards. Our success depends on our ability to: &#8226; timely identify industry changes, adapt our strategies, and develop new or enhance and maintain existing products and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets, including due to unexpected changes in industry standards or disruptive technological innovation that could render our products incompatible with products developed by other companies; &#8226; develop or acquire new products and technologies through investments in research and development; &#8226; launch new offerings with new business models including software, services, and cloud solutions, as well as software-, infrastructure-, or platform-as-a-service solutions; &#8226; expand the ecosystem for our products and technologies; &#8226; meet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety, security, reliability expectations, and compliance standards; &#8226; manage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end-user satisfaction; &#8226; develop, acquire, maintain, and secure access to the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business, including sufficient energy for powering data centers using our products, acquisition integrations, customer support, e-commerce, IP licensing capabilities and cloud service capacity; and &#8226; complete technical, financial, operational, compliance, sales and marketing investments for the above activities. We have invested in research and development in markets where we have a limited operating history, which may not produce meaningful revenue for several years, if at all. If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or if they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins may involve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers will demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future design wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that the products and technologies we bring to market will provide value to our customers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed. '
 'Nvidia (NVDA), a giant in data centers and gaming, is supercharging investor interest in artificial intelligence. Is Nvidia stock a buy?\n\nX\n\nSemiconductor, AI News\n\nOn Dec. 6, AMD (AMD) released a new AI chip, offering new competition to Nvidia in the huge, fast-growing market.\n\nIn November, Nvidia delivered another quarterly earnings beat-and-raise report. It also unveiled the H200, its latest graphics processing unit for training AI models.\n\nThe AI chip leader has suffered recently from reports that the U.S. will move to crack down on redesigned Nvidia AI (artificial intelligence) chips, which were intended to get around export controls.\n\nCompanies like Nvidia, AMD and Microsoft (MSFT) tap the emerging market for generative AI. Generative AI can create content, including written articles, from simple phrases by analyzing vast amounts of data. It can also write programming code.\n\nFor those looking for the top large-cap stocks to buy now, here\'s a dive into NVDA.\n\nNvidia Stock Technical Analysis\n\nThe AI chip leader broke out past a 476.09 buy point from a double-bottom base in early November, reaching a record 505.48 on Nov. 20. However, the advance from the Oct. 31 low came on light volume, the IBD MarketSmith chart shows.\n\nThe stock stumbled after Nvidia\'s Nov. 21 earnings report, falling back below the buy point and 21-day line. But it has found recent support at the 50-day line.\n\nIf NVDA stock gets back above the entry, the buy zone would go to 499.89, according to IBD Leaderboard.\n\nNvidia stock tested the still-valid 476.09 buy point on Dec. 8, but closed below it.\n\nThe relative strength line for Nvidia stock is starting to show some lag after rallying for most of 2023. A rising RS line, the blue line in IBD charts, shows that a stock is outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nAfter a painful 2022, NVDA stock has soared more than 223% year to date. It mostly held up better than growth stocks at large during recent market sell-offs.\n\nNvidia joined IBD Leaderboard after gapping up on earnings in February.\n\nNVDA earns an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. In other words, Nvidia stock is in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of technical and fundamental metrics.\n\nInvestors generally should focus on stocks with Comp Ratings of 90 or even 95 and above. Nvidia stock often earns a spot on the IBD 50, Big Cap 20 and Sector Leaders lists.\n\nThe IBD Stock Checkup tool shows that NVDA carries a Relative Strength Rating of 97. That means it has outperformed 97% of all other stocks over the past year.\n\nThe iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) holds both Nvidia stock and AMD stock.\n\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis\n\nNvidia Earnings\n\nNvidia\'s EPS Rating is a perfect 99 and its SMR Rating is an A, on a scale of A to a worst E. The EPS rating compares a company\'s earnings growth to other stocks. Its SMR Rating gauges sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.\n\nOn Nov. 21, Nvidia disclosed earnings rocketed 593% in the third quarter and revenue soared 206%, an overall beat.\n\nNvidia earnings accelerated from a 429% gain the prior quarter. Sales growth also sped up sharply from the previous quarter. The chip giant guided Q4 sales of $20 billion, up 231%.\n\nIn Q3, data-center revenue surged 279%. The business includes the A100 and H100 AI chips.\n\nFor the full year, analysts now expect Nvidia earnings to rebound 264% as sales jump 118%. Last year, Nvidia earnings fell 25% per share.\n\nOut of 54 analysts covering NVDA stock, 51 rate it a buy. Three have a hold and no one has a sell, according to FactSet.\n\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners? Start With These 3 Steps\n\nNVDA Backstory, Rivals\n\nThe fabless chipmaker pioneered graphics processing units, or GPUs, to make video games more realistic. It\'s expanding in AI chips, used in supercomputers, data centers and drug development.\n\nNvidia\'s GPUs act as accelerators for central processing units, or CPUs, made by other companies. It\'s working on ""supercomputers"" combining its own CPUs and GPUs.\n\nIn addition, Nvidia chips are used for Bitcoin mining and self-driving electric cars.\n\nNvidia has made a big push into metaverse applications.\n\nFabless chip stocks include Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).\n\nCurrently, the fabless group ranks No. 92 out of 197 industry groups. Fabless companies design the hardware while outsourcing the manufacturing to a third-party firm.\n\nFor the best returns, investors should focus on companies that are leading the market and their own industry group.\n\nIs Nvidia Stock A Buy?\n\nOn a fundamental level, Nvidia is poised for explosive growth. Earnings should more than triple this fiscal year, driven by booming chip sales for data centers and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe fabless chipmaker is expanding in other growth areas, such as automated electric cars, cloud gaming and the metaverse as well.\n\nBut AI competition is intensifying. Macroeconomic uncertainties linger. Geopolitical risks are also rife, from the U.S.-China trade war to actual war in Ukraine and Israel.\n\nNVDA stock has staged a massive comeback, more than tripling in 2023 so far. Nvidia came under pressure after its latest earnings report. Shares are now rebounding from a key level, with the AI chip stock flirting with the buy point again.\n\nBottom line: Nvidia stock is not a buy right now, but it could be soon. As a chip company with exposure to top growth markets, NVDA is always one to watch.\n\nCheck out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD content to find dozens of the best stocks to buy or watch.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nSee The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch\n\nCatch The Next Big Winning Stock With MarketSmith\n\nJoin IBD Live And Learn Top Chart-Reading And Trading Techniques From The Pros\n\n']","In general, Nvidia is the better choice because Nvidia is the leading company in AI chip market. Although AMD releases chips with comparable performance, it is still always catching up to Nvidia. Moreover, AMD stock is over valued with much higher PE ratio than Nvidia. Although Nvidia has risk factors such as the long term demand for AI chip might change and the overseas regulation caused a decrease in datacenter revenue in China; AMD is facing similar risk. In conclusion, Nvidia is the better company to invest more due to its market leadership and the current hype of AI.",167,0.8055555555287036,1.0,0.8678608690853841,0.6666666666666666,0.37499999953124996

PLEASE REVIEW","['Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Revenue Recognition Revenue Allowances For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development Arrangements Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.

 'Users in India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria repr esented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during December 2023, relative to the same period in 2022. &#8226; Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook. As of December 31, 2023, we had 3.07 billion MAUs, an increase of 3% from December 31, 2022. Users in India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria represented the top three sources of growth in 2023, relative to the same period in 2022. Table of Contents Trends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. See ""Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)"" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States &#38; Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2023 in the United States &#38; Canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region. --- ARPU: -- $11.57 --- $9.54 --- $9.82 --- $9.41 --- $10.86 ---- $9.62 ---- $10.63 ---- $11.23 --- $13.12 - - -- ARPU: -- $60.57 -- $48.29 -- $50.25 -- $49.13 --- $58.77 -- $48.85 --- $53.53 --- $56.11 --- $68.44 -------- ARPU: -- $19.68 -- $15.35 -- $15.64 -- $14.23 -- $17.29 --- $15.51 -- $17.88 --- $19.04 --- $23.14 - ARPU: -- $4.89 ---- $4.47 ---- $4.54 ---- $4.42 ---- $4.61 ---- $4.52 ---- $4.88 ----- $5.12 ---- $5.52 ------- ARPU: -- $3.43 ----- $3.14 ---- $3.35 ---- $3.21 ---- $3.52 ---- $3.35 ---- $3.76 ----- $4.22 ---- $4.50 ##TABLE_START Ad Revenue Non-Ad Revenue ##TABLE_END Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources. Table of Contents Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 &#8212; Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplemental Data"" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers. Our annual worldwide ARPU in 2023, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $44.60, an increase of 13% from 2022. For 2023, ARPU increased by 21% in Europe, 20% in Rest of World, 11% in Asia-Pacific, and 10% in United States &#38; Canada. User growth was mostly in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia&#8209;Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region. Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Loss Contingencies We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. '
 'Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected. We may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products. We have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications that integrate with our products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building, growing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including platforms controlled by third parties, rather than building products that integrate with our products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to privacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some instances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected. Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results Our business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business. We compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. We also expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate through the development and application of new technologies such as AI. Some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments, geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In addition, from time to time we make updates to our products and services to improve the user experience (including to help provide users with safe, positive, age-appropriate experiences), and these changes have had, and may in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products and services. In the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed. Our competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads; by imposing fees or other charges related to our applications or our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult to communicate with our users; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure ads effectively. '
 'In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.\n\nWith such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\n\nAt a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P/S. Thus, it looks much more reasonably valued than NVIDIA, especially considering its five-year mean P/S of eight. However, a neutral view might be appropriate in the near term due to the geopolitical overhang for Taiwanese stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enjoyed a nice 11% lift over the last five days due to NVIDIA’s good news, enjoying their best week in almost a year. TSM is likely to see some sales increase from the AI transition because it manufactures NVIDIA’s chips, but any impact is likely to be modest.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could face issues amid the growing tensions between Taiwan and China, which convinced Warren Buffett to dump most of his $4.1 billion stake after less than a year. Given Buffett’s long-term focus, it’s highly unusual that he would sell the position after holding it for such a short time.\n\nThus, while Taiwan Semiconductor could end up being an excellent long-term investment at current prices, the recent rally paired with the geopolitical tensions suggests a neutral view for now.\n\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sells assigned over the last three months. At $118.67, the average Taiwan Semiconductor stock price target implies upside potential of 19.93%.\n\nConclusion: Bearish on NVDA, Neutral on TSM\n\nNVIDIA and TSM clearly have excellent long-term prospects, given their AI exposure. However, it seems like buying NVIDIA shares at current prices could be playing with fire, given its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price.\n\nTSM’s valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI, but the geopolitical overhang adds significant risk to owning the shares.\n\nDisclosure']","Facebook's strategy in the Asia-Pacific region concentrates on increasing ARPU, seeking to monetize its substantial user base more effectively in a rapidly growing market.

- Integration of advanced AI-powered software could offer more personalized and efficient parental controls and time management options for users.
- The commitment to child safety through AI initiatives may result in the development of more robust parental supervision tools to create a safer online environment for children.

Overall, Meta's advancements in AI technology could positively influence the development and effectiveness of parental supervision tools and user time management features on Facebook and Instagram, potentially leading to a safer and more controlled online experience for users.

PLEASE REVIEW","['While Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our feed and Stories products and we expect it will continue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more regions from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which continued to adversely affect user growth and engagement in 2023. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue in 2023, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future. Although we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors driving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified advertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precision which advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising revenue during the periods presented. Table of Contents Investment Philosophy We expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several efforts to increase our operating efficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant opportunities. In 2023, 80% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 20% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies for the metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology development across these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the metaverse that may only be fully realized in the next decade. In 2023, our RL segment reduced our overall operating profit by approximately $16.12 billion, and we expect our RL operating losses to increase meaningfully in 2024. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods. Table of Contents Trends in Our Family Metrics The numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products. Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices. &#8226; Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp (collectively, our ""Family"" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ------ DAP/MAP: ------ 79% ------- 79% -------- 79% -------- 79% --------- 79% -------- 79% -------- 79% -------- 79% -------- 80% Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 30 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in September 2022.

 'Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (&#8220;SA&#8221;). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 &#8211; Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. PART II Item 8 &#160; Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.

 'Update on January 18, 2024 at 3:00AM PT:\n\nSleep is important, particularly for young people, so we’re launching new nighttime nudges that will show up when teens have spent more than 10 minutes on Instagram in places like Reels or Direct Messages late at night. They’ll remind teens that it’s late, and encourage them to close the app.\n\nUpdate on November 9, 2023 at 9:00AM PT:\n\nParental supervision tools are now available globally on Facebook, in addition to Instagram, Messenger, and Horizon Worlds. Parents can access Facebook supervision via Settings to see insights like time spent, schedule breaks for their teens and access expert resources on managing their teens’ time online. We’re also adding more supervision features to Messenger, including giving parents the ability to set scheduled breaks and view their teens’ blocked contacts.\n\nUpdate on August 30, 2023 at 9:00PM PT:\n\nParental supervision tools on Messenger are now available globally.\n\nOriginally published on June 27, 2023 at 2:00AM PT:\n\nParental Supervision Tools on Messenger\n\nToday, we’re announcing parental supervision tools on Messenger. Now parents and guardians can access Messenger supervision tools and resources from leading experts to support their teens through the Meta Family Center. Parental Supervision on Messenger is available in the US, UK, and Canada today, with plans to expand to more countries around the world in the coming months.\n\nThese tools allow parents to see how their teen uses Messenger, from how much time they’re spending on messaging to providing information about their teen’s message settings. These tools do not allow parents to read their teen’s messages.\n\nSpecifically, our first set of parental supervision tools on Messenger will allow parents and guardians to:\n\nView how much time their teen spends on Messenger\n\nView and receive updates on their teen’s Messenger contacts list, as well as their teen’s privacy and safety settings\n\nGet notified if their teen reports someone (if the teen chooses to share that information)\n\nView who can message their teen (only their friends, friends of friends, or no one) and see if their teen changes this setting\n\nView who can see their teen’s Messenger stories and get notified if these settings change\n\nOver the next year, we’ll add more features to Parental Supervision on Messenger so parents can help their teens better manage their time and interactions, while still balancing their privacy as these tools function in both unencrypted and end-to-end encrypted chats.\n\nToday’s update is part of our ongoing work to establish Family Center as one central place where parents and guardians can find resources and tools to help manage their teens’ experiences across Meta technologies, and strengthen the dialogue between parents and teens about their online lives.\n\nTesting New Messaging Privacy Features\n\nWe want to protect people from unwanted interactions in Instagram DMs, and these protections are especially important when it comes to teens. We already show Safety Notices when adults who have shown potentially suspicious behavior message teens, and we restrict people over 19 years old from sending private messages to teens who don’t follow them. We’re now testing additional features to limit how people can interact with and message others who don’t follow them:\n\nBefore being able to message someone who doesn’t follow them, people must now send an invite to get their permission to connect. People can only send one invite at a time and can’t send more until the recipient accepts the invitation to connect.\n\nWe’ll limit these message request invites to text only, so people can’t send any photos, videos, or voice messages, or make calls, until the recipient has accepted the invite to chat. These changes mean people won’t receive unwanted photos, videos, or other types of media from people they don’t follow.\n\nNudging Teens to Manage Their Time on Facebook and Instagram\n\nWe want teens to feel good about the time they spend on our apps, which is why we’ve built features like Take a Break on Instagram. Soon, teens will also see a notification when they’ve spent 20 minutes on Facebook, prompting them to take time away from the app and set daily time limits. We’re also exploring a new nudge on Instagram that suggests teens close the app if they are scrolling Reels at night.\n\nIn January, we introduced Quiet Mode on Instagram, a new feature to help people focus and to encourage them to set boundaries with their friends and followers. For example, when you turn on Quiet Mode, you won’t receive any notifications, your profile’s activity status will change to let people know you’re in Quiet Mode, and we’ll automatically send an auto-reply when someone sends you a DM. We’re making Quiet Mode available to everyone on Instagram globally in the coming weeks.\n\nAdditional Parental Supervision Features on Instagram\n\nWe’ve added additional tools to Parental Supervision on Instagram to give parents more visibility into their teens’ experiences on the app and to prompt teens to have conversations with their parents with new notifications. These updates include:\n\nA new notice to teens after they’ve blocked someone. The notice encourages teens to add their parents to supervise their Instagram account as an extra layer of support. Through this notice, we’re meeting teens at specific moments to remind them how they can benefit from parental guidance when it comes to navigating their online interactions.\n\nIn addition to seeing which accounts their teen follows and is followed by, parents will now be able to see how many friends their teen has in common with those accounts. This will help parents understand how well their teen knows these accounts, and help prompt offline conversations about those connections.\n\nMore ways for parents to customize which notifications from Parental Supervision on Instagram they want to receive and how often they receive them.\n\nToday’s updates were designed to help teens feel in control of their online experiences and help parents feel equipped to support their teens. We’ll continue to collaborate with parents and experts to develop additional features that support teens and their families.'

Meanwhile, AMD designs processors and related technologies for AI, data centers, gaming, and business-computing applications.\n\nShares of NVDA are up 240% year-to-date. Meanwhile, AMD stock has gained 93% year-to-date, including a 20% return over the last three months.\n\nDespite NVIDIA’s much higher gains this year, it’s trading at a much lower valuation than AMD. We’ll look at their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is currently trading at a P/E of 46.4 versus its three-year average P/E of 29.9.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of around 64.3, NVIDIA is trading at a relatively small premium to its industry (compared to AMD’s premium anyway). In fact, the stock hasn’t been this cheap in a year, and its long-term gains also suggest a bullish view might be appropriate despite the tremendous year-to-date gain.\n\nOn a P/E basis, NVIDIA hasn’t been this cheap since December 2022. In fact, NVIDIA was trading at a P/E of over 100 just days ago — before the last earnings report. Of course, significantly higher earnings send a company’s P/E much lower if its stock price doesn’t change dramatically.\n\nIn NVIDIA’s case, its earnings exploded so much higher year-over-year that its P/E was cut nearly in half after just a small pullback from around $500 a share on November 22 to $489 on November 24. For its third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.02 per share on $18.1 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of $3.37 per share on $16.2 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a comparative basis, NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, while its adjusted earnings rose nearly sevenfold year-over-year and 49% quarter-over-quarter. The chipmaker’s GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings rose more than 13 times from a year ago to $3.71 per share, also demonstrating exploding growth.\n\nBefore that earnings report, NVIDIA shares had soared to a record high of around $505 with a P/E of about 120 in November. Normally, I wouldn’t suggest a bullish view of a stock that has risen so much, so fast.\n\nHowever, once the market recognizes its lower valuation — and recovers from management’s warning about significantly lower sales to China and other countries due to export restrictions — NVIDIA shares will likely continue their tear. Despite that warning, the chipmaker still guided for almost 231% revenue growth to $20 billion in the fourth quarter, so it clearly isn’t all that worried.\n\nEven if the stock doesn’t recover dramatically in the near term, NVIDIA’s long-term stock-price gains of 267% over the last three years, 1,184% over the last five, and 13,066% over the last 10 provide some level of safety over the long term. In fact, I would use any near-term pullbacks to add to the position.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $660.39, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies upside potential of 36.7%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAt a P/E of 1,120, Advanced Micro Devices has the opposite problem of NVIDIA. Its valuation has skyrocketed because it’s now barely profitable. However, the chipmaker certainly isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so it’s only a matter of time before it bounces back. For now, though, a bearish view seems appropriate, pending a better entry price or improved earnings numbers.\n\nIn the third quarter, AMD reported $299 million in GAAP net income, although that was an improvement from net income of $66 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company’s net income rose 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. AMD also reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the quarter, up from $5.6 billion a year ago.\n\nUnfortunately, AMD continues to play catch-up to NVIDIA in the area of artificial intelligence, although management did reveal some progress on its last earnings call, announcing improvements in the company’s AI software capabilities through R&D and acquisitions. Management also expects the MI300 data center chip, which will support AI models, to be “the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.” In short, AMD will likely catch up to NVIDIA at some point, but we’re not there yet.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for AMD Stock?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $126.79, the average AMD stock price target implies upside potential of 2.9%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on NVDA, Bearish on AMD\n\nThe battle between NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices has been going on for years, with one company pulling out in front of the other and then the other catching up and trading places. Nonetheless, neither of these companies is going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nHowever, AMD could be playing catch-up to NVIDIA on AI for some time, calling for a wait-and-see approach. Meanwhile, NVIDIA will likely rerate higher once the market digests management’s warning about the new export restrictions.\n\nDisclosure'

"In fiscal year 2024, what was the impact on NVIDIA's operating income due to the change in estimated useful life of its server, storage, and network equipment, and what was the percentage year-over-year increase in NVIDIA’s revenue?","Based on the data provided by the Gatherer, here is the information relevant to your query:

1. Impact on Nvidia's Operating Income due to Change in Estimated Useful Life of Server, Storage, and Network Equipment:
   - In its fiscal year 2024, Nvidia experienced a significant increase in data center revenue, with $47.5 billion generated compared to $15 billion in the previous year. This substantial growth in data center revenue could indicate a positive impact on Nvidia's operating income due to the change in the estimated useful life of its server, storage, and network equipment. However, the exact numerical impact on operating income is not explicitly mentioned in the data provided.

2. Percentage Year-over-Year Increase in Nvidia’s Revenue:
   - In the fiscal year ending January 28, 2024, Nvidia reported annual revenue of $60.92 billion, representing a remarkable growth rate of 125.85% compared to the previous year. Additionally, in the quarter ending January 28, 2024, Nvidia's revenue was $22.10 billion, showing a substantial year-over-year growth rate of 265.28%.

In conclusion, while the data highlights the impressive revenue growth for Nvidia in fiscal year 2024, the specific impact on operating income due to the change in estimated useful life of server, storage, and network equipment is not explicitly provided. For a more detailed analysis of the impact on operating income, further specific financial data or statements from Nvidia would be required.

PLEASE REVIEW","['Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Revenue Recognition Revenue Allowances For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development Arrangements Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below.

 'Users in India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria repr esented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during December 2023, relative to the same period in 2022. &#8226; Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook. As of December 31, 2023, we had 3.07 billion MAUs, an increase of 3% from December 31, 2022. Users in India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria represented the top three sources of growth in 2023, relative to the same period in 2022. Table of Contents Trends in Our Monetization by Facebook User Geography We calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users who are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantial majority of our total revenue. See ""Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)"" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States &#38; Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2023 in the United States &#38; Canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region. --- ARPU: -- $11.57 --- $9.54 --- $9.82 --- $9.41 --- $10.86 ---- $9.62 ---- $10.63 ---- $11.23 --- $13.12 - - -- ARPU: -- $60.57 -- $48.29 -- $50.25 -- $49.13 --- $58.77 -- $48.85 --- $53.53 --- $56.11 --- $68.44 -------- ARPU: -- $19.68 -- $15.35 -- $15.64 -- $14.23 -- $17.29 --- $15.51 -- $17.88 --- $19.04 --- $23.14 - ARPU: -- $4.89 ---- $4.47 ---- $4.54 ---- $4.42 ---- $4.61 ---- $4.52 ---- $4.88 ----- $5.12 ---- $5.52 ------- ARPU: -- $3.43 ----- $3.14 ---- $3.35 ---- $3.21 ---- $3.52 ---- $3.35 ---- $3.76 ----- $4.22 ---- $4.50 ##TABLE_START Ad Revenue Non-Ad Revenue ##TABLE_END Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources. Table of Contents Our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 &#8212; Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplemental Data"" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers. Our annual worldwide ARPU in 2023, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $44.60, an increase of 13% from 2022. For 2023, ARPU increased by 21% in Europe, 20% in Rest of World, 11% in Asia-Pacific, and 10% in United States &#38; Canada. User growth was mostly in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia&#8209;Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region. Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Loss Contingencies We are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Meanwhile, AMD stock has gained 93% year-to-date, including a 20% return over the last three months.\n\nDespite NVIDIA’s much higher gains this year, it’s trading at a much lower valuation than AMD. We’ll look at their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is currently trading at a P/E of 46.4 versus its three-year average P/E of 29.9.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of around 64.3, NVIDIA is trading at a relatively small premium to its industry (compared to AMD’s premium anyway). In fact, the stock hasn’t been this cheap in a year, and its long-term gains also suggest a bullish view might be appropriate despite the tremendous year-to-date gain.\n\nOn a P/E basis, NVIDIA hasn’t been this cheap since December 2022. In fact, NVIDIA was trading at a P/E of over 100 just days ago — before the last earnings report. Of course, significantly higher earnings send a company’s P/E much lower if its stock price doesn’t change dramatically.\n\nIn NVIDIA’s case, its earnings exploded so much higher year-over-year that its P/E was cut nearly in half after just a small pullback from around $500 a share on November 22 to $489 on November 24. For its third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $4.02 per share on $18.1 billion in revenue versus the consensus estimates of $3.37 per share on $16.2 billion in revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a comparative basis, NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year and 34% quarter-over-quarter, while its adjusted earnings rose nearly sevenfold year-over-year and 49% quarter-over-quarter. The chipmaker’s GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings rose more than 13 times from a year ago to $3.71 per share, also demonstrating exploding growth.\n\nBefore that earnings report, NVIDIA shares had soared to a record high of around $505 with a P/E of about 120 in November. Normally, I wouldn’t suggest a bullish view of a stock that has risen so much, so fast.\n\nHowever, once the market recognizes its lower valuation — and recovers from management’s warning about significantly lower sales to China and other countries due to export restrictions — NVIDIA shares will likely continue their tear. Despite that warning, the chipmaker still guided for almost 231% revenue growth to $20 billion in the fourth quarter, so it clearly isn’t all that worried.\n\nEven if the stock doesn’t recover dramatically in the near term, NVIDIA’s long-term stock-price gains of 267% over the last three years, 1,184% over the last five, and 13,066% over the last 10 provide some level of safety over the long term. In fact, I would use any near-term pullbacks to add to the position.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for NVDA Stock?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buys, three Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $660.39, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies upside potential of 36.7%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAt a P/E of 1,120, Advanced Micro Devices has the opposite problem of NVIDIA. Its valuation has skyrocketed because it’s now barely profitable. However, the chipmaker certainly isn’t going anywhere anytime soon, so it’s only a matter of time before it bounces back. For now, though, a bearish view seems appropriate, pending a better entry price or improved earnings numbers.\n\nIn the third quarter, AMD reported $299 million in GAAP net income, although that was an improvement from net income of $66 million a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company’s net income rose 4% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. AMD also reported revenue of $5.8 billion for the quarter, up from $5.6 billion a year ago.\n\nUnfortunately, AMD continues to play catch-up to NVIDIA in the area of artificial intelligence, although management did reveal some progress on its last earnings call, announcing improvements in the company’s AI software capabilities through R&D and acquisitions. Management also expects the MI300 data center chip, which will support AI models, to be “the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history.” In short, AMD will likely catch up to NVIDIA at some point, but we’re not there yet.\n\nWhat is the Price Target for AMD Stock?\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, seven Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $126.79, the average AMD stock price target implies upside potential of 2.9%.\n\nConclusion: Bullish on NVDA, Bearish on AMD\n\nThe battle between NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices has been going on for years, with one company pulling out in front of the other and then the other catching up and trading places. Nonetheless, neither of these companies is going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nHowever, AMD could be playing catch-up to NVIDIA on AI for some time, calling for a wait-and-see approach. Meanwhile, NVIDIA will likely rerate higher once the market digests management’s warning about the new export restrictions.\n\nDisclosure'

For a discussion of the year ended June 30 , 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, please refer to Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. OVERVIEW Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We are creating the platforms and tools, powered by artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;), that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support small and large business competitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes, grow public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity. We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes. Highlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included: &#8226; Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion. &#8226; Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 13%. &#8226; Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 67.0 million. &#8226; LinkedIn revenue increased 10%. &#8226; Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%. &#8226; Server products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 29%. &#8226; Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (&#8220;Windows OEM&#8221;) revenue decreased 25%. &#8226; Devices revenue decreased 24%. &#8226; Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%. &#8226; Xbox content and services revenue decreased 3%. &#8226; Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 11%. Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. PART II Item 7 &#160; Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user&#8217;s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (&#8220;GPUs&#8221;) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one&#8217;s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023. On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (&#8220;Q2 charge&#8221;), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. ']","The change in estimated useful life of NVIDIA's server, storage, and network equipment resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million for fiscal year 2024. NVIDIA’s revenue jumped 206% year-over-year.",171,0.7499999999625,0.8571428571428571,0.8013485155463741,1.0,0.1999999998
"In the context of the graphics card market, how do the high-end AMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards compare in terms of price and performance with Nvidia’s RTX 40 series, and how does AMD's approach to ray tracing in these cards differ from Nvidia's?","Based on the information gathered, here is a comparison of the high-end AMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards with NVIDIA's RTX 40 series in terms of price and performance, as well as how AMD's approach to ray tracing differs from NVIDIA's:

**Price and Performance Comparison:**
- In 4K gaming tests, the NVIDIA RTX 4090 averaged 113 frames per second (fps), while the AMD RX 7900 XTX managed 76.4 fps on average. This indicates a significant 47% increase in performance for the RTX 4090 over the RX 7900 XTX.
- From a pure gaming perspective, the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX provides a fast and fluid gaming experience in 4K, matching or even beating that of the more expensive NVIDIA RTX 4080.
- The AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT, a midrange option, is praised for its positive attributes and is considered one of the best midrange GPUs available.

**Ray Tracing Approach:**
- While AMD's ray tracing performance generally lags behind NVIDIA's, the Radeon RX 7000 series still holds its ground in this aspect. AMD's approach to ray tracing in these cards differs from NVIDIA's by offering competitive performance despite being slightly behind NVIDIA in this specific technology.

In summary, the high-end AMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards offer competitive performance in gaming, especially in 4K scenarios, and despite trailing NVIDIA in ray tracing performance, AMD manages to provide a compelling alternative with its RX 7000 series.

PLEASE REVIEW","['This morning is an important one for AMD – perhaps the most important of the year. After almost a year and a half of build-up, and even longer for actual development, AMD is launching their next generation GPU/APU/AI accelerator family, the Instinct MI300 series. Based on AMD\'s new CDNA 3 architecture, and combining it with AMD\'s proven Zen 4 cores, AMD will be making a full-court press for the high-end GPU and accelerator market with their new product, aiming to lead in both big-metal HPC as well as the burgeoning market for generative AI training and inference.\n\nTaking the stage for AMD\'s launch event will be AMD CEO Dr. LIsa Su, as well as a numerous AMD executives and ecosystem partners, to detail, at last, AMD\'s latest generation GPU architecture, and the many forms it will come in. With both the MI300X accelerator and MI300A APU, AMD is aiming to cover most of the accelerator market, whether clients just need a powerful GPU or a tightly-coupled GPU/CPU pairing.\n\nThe stakes for today\'s announcement are significant. The market for generative AI is all but hardware constrained at the moment, much to the benefit of (and profits for) AMD\'s rival NVIDIA. So AMD is hoping to capitalize on this moment to cut off a piece – perhaps a very big piece – of the market for generative AI accelerators. AMD has made breaking into the server space their highest priority over the last half-decade, and now, they believe, is their time to take a big piece of the server GPU market.\n\n12:56PM EST - We\'re here in San Jose for AMD\'s final and most important launch event of the year: Advancing AI\n\n12:57PM EST - Today AMD is making the eagerly anticipated launch of their next-generation MI300 series of accelerators\n\n12:58PM EST - Including MI300A, their first chiplet-based server APU, and MI300X, their stab at the most powerful GPU/accelerator possible for the AI market\n\n12:59PM EST - I\'d say the event is being held in AMD\'s backyard, but since AMD sold their campus here in the bay area several years ago, this is more like NVIDIA\'s backyard.

 'Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Revenue Recognition Revenue Allowances For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development Arrangements Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com. The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue. ##TABLE_START &#160; Year Ended &#160; Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 27.3 43.1 Gross profit 72.7 56.9 Operating expenses &#160; Research and development 14.2 27.2 Sales, general and administrative 4.4 9.1 Acquisition termination cost &#8212; 5.0 Total operating expenses 18.6 41.3 Operating income 54.1 15.6 Interest income 1.4 1.0 Interest expense (0.4) (1.0) Other, net 0.4 (0.1) Other income (expense), net 1.4 (0.1) Income before income tax 55.5 15.5 Income tax expense (benefit) 6.6 (0.7) Net income 48.9 % 16.2 % ##TABLE_END Reportable Segments Revenue by Reportable Segments ##TABLE_START Year Ended Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Compute &#38; Networking $ 47,405 $ 15,068 $ 32,337 215 % Graphics 13,517 11,906 1,611 14 % Total $ 60,922 $ 26,974 $ 33,948 126 % ##TABLE_END Operating Income by Reportable Segments ##TABLE_START Year Ended Jan 28, 2024 Jan 29, 2023 $ Change % Change ($ in millions) Compute &#38; Networking $ 32,016 $ 5,083 $ 26,933 530 % Graphics 5,846 4,552 1,294 28 % All Other (4,890) (5,411) 521 (10) % Total $ 32,972 $ 4,224 $ 28,748 681 % ##TABLE_END Compute &#38; Networking revenue &#8211; The year-on-year increase was due to higher Data Center revenue. Compute grew 266% due to higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform for the training and inference of LLMs, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. Networking was up 133% due to higher shipments of InfiniBand. Graphics revenue &#8211; The year-on-year increase was led by growth in Gaming of 15% driven by higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels. Reportable segment operating income &#8211; The year-on-year increase in Compute &#38; Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue. All Other operating loss - The year-on-year decrease was due to the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a $839 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2024. '
 'For example, our Client segment revenue decreased due to a decline in the PC market in the second half of 2022 and the first half of 2023, and our Embedded segment revenue decreased as a result of an inventory correction in several end markets in the second half of 2023. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products. Excess or obsolete inventory have resulted in, and may in the future result in, write-downs of the value of our inventory. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, we recorded certain charges primarily for inventory, pricing and related reserves in the Gaming and Client segments. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, a reduction in the average selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions. Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner includes the use of third-party intellectual property. In the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties that incorporate into our software or hardware. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, or laws are adopted that affect our use of third party intellectual property in certain regions or products, our business could be materially adversely affected. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business and products. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, drivers), memory and other components that we use to design, support and sell, and our customers utilize to support and/or use our product offerings. We also rely on our AIB partners to support our products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on, utilized in, or support our products, or laws are adopted that result in the same, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we lose Microsoft Corporation&#8217;s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors&#8217; products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors&#8217; products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. We extend credit to certain of our distributors and AIB partners. If we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners or incur higher allowances for credit losses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.

 'Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (&#8220;SA&#8221;). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 &#8211; Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. PART II Item 8 &#160; Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.

Whether it's a custom computer or a pre-built model, a graphics card is essential for rendering games in high quality, and cards from either Nvidia or AMD are what you'll find in all of the best gaming PCs and best gaming laptops.\n\nBoth brands offer a range of graphics cards with entry-level models starting at around $270 and high-end cards costing $1,500 or more. AMD and Nvidia also allow other manufacturers to sell third-party versions of their cards based on their original specs. This can create price variations among models with similar capabilities, since third-party manufacturers may add features like extra fans or lighting.\n\nWhile there are lots of graphics cards to choose from, it's still possible to compare each brand's overall performance in relation to their price. Premium Nvidia graphics cards are typically viewed as the most powerful when it comes to advanced features, while the best AMD cards have a reputation for being significantly more affordable and energy efficient.\n\nBelow, we've broken down details on all the latest graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD, and compare how they stack up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: Price and features\n\nAMD and Nvidia both offer a range of graphics cards for different budgets and performance needs. Nvidia's current lineup is called the GeForce RTX 40 series, while AMD's lineup is called the Radeon RX 7000 series. Here's a rundown of each series.\n\nNote: The cards listed below are for desktop computers. Both brands also make mobile versions of their cards that PC manufacturers can integrate into their gaming laptops, but performance may vary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 40 series graphics cards\n\nThe Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 is the company's most powerful graphics card. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's RTX 40 series debuted in fall 2022 with the release of the flagship GeForce RTX 4080 ($1,199) and the premium RTX 4090 ($1,599); four more affordable RTX 40 series cards arrived in 2023.\n\nRTX 40 series cards share a wide range of features, including raytracing, an advanced lighting feature that requires a compatible graphics card, and DLSS 3.0, the latest version of Nvidia's AI-enhanced upscaling technology that makes games easier to run at high frame rates.\n\nOther Nvidia features are designed to benefit content creators; RTX cards include support for AI-based noise removal for your microphone and virtual backgrounds for your webcam, as well as face tracking and auto-focus. However, AMD reports that its graphics cards actually render video faster than the RTX 40 series with common editing programs like Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve Studio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards\n\nAn AMD Radeon RX 7000 series card being used with an AMD Ryzen CPU. XFX\n\nAMD launched the Radeon RX 7000 series of graphics cards in December 2022 with the RX 7900 XT ($899) and 7900 XTX ($999), followed by the release of several lower priced cards in 2023, including the 7700XT and 7800XT which are set to launch on September 6.\n\nAMD cards offer similar performance to Nvidia cards in most games, and usually for a lower price. For example, Tom's Hardware ranks the RX 7900 XT ($999) ahead of the RTX 4080 ($1,199) in terms of overall performance, despite the AMD card typically being $200 cheaper. However, Nvidia cards tend to reveal bigger advantages when you play newer games with more advanced graphical features.\n\nLike the RTX 40 series, AMD's RX 7000 cards do feature ray tracing, but ray tracing performance generally lags behind the RTX 40 series with slower frame rates. The RX 7000 series also has an AI-based rendering feature to improve frame rates, called FSR, but it's not quite as developed as Nvidia's DLSS.\n\nIf you're looking to play newer releases like Cyberpunk 2077 or Allen Wake 2, a weaker AMD card may struggle to deliver graphics at the highest possible quality. That said, AMD does partner with some developers to boost performance on AMD hardware; for example, Microsoft's Starfield was designed with support for AMD's FSR at release, but not DLSS.\n\nAMD also supports a feature called Smart Access Memory to improve performance when you pair its latest CPUs and GPUs together. This feature allows the CPU to use more of the graphics card's memory. However, some Nvidia and Intel hardware can take advantage of a similar feature, called Resizable Bar, so the underlying tech isn't AMD exclusive.\n\nAMD benchmark data that shows RX 7000 graphics cards outperforming Nvidia hardware exclusively use AMD processors during testing, so if you have an Intel processor, you may want to look at publicly sourced benchmarks before buying an AMD card.\n\n*The target resolution and refresh rates for each graphics card were determined based on benchmarks shared by Nvidia, AMD, and crowd sourced data from the public. The maximum frame rate and resolution possible with each card will vary based on the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAMD vs. Nvidia: Which graphics card should you choose?\n\nUltimately, choosing between an AMD or Nvidia graphics card comes down to your personal needs, budget, and preferences. Those building their own PC with a smaller budget may prefer the affordability of AMD graphics cards, while those willing to pay more to play brand-new games with graphics that can best the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X will likely want an Nvidia 4080 or 4090 card to maximize performance.\n\nOf course, high-end AMD cards like the RX 7900 XT or RX 7900 XTX are still capable of playing the latest releases, but Nvidia's top models have an edge when you enable advanced features like ray tracing.\n\nFAQs\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat should you know before buying a graphics card?\n\nBefore you buy any graphics card, you should make sure that it's a good fit for your computer. Using an older CPU or motherboard with a brand-new graphics card can limit your overall performance and create bottlenecks that prevent you from getting the most out of your card.\n\nCheck that your motherboard supports the latest specifications, like PCIe 4.0. Newer graphics cards also demand lots of power, so make sure your power supply has enough juice to keep your computer running.\n\nFinally, always measure the inside of your case to make sure the graphics card will physically fit during installation, as different cases can position the graphics card at different angles. Different manufacturers also make different sized versions of the same graphics card to add extra fans or lighting.""]","High-end AMD Radeon RX 7000 series graphics cards, like the RX 7900 XT, are typically priced $200 cheaper than Nvidia's RTX 40 series cards, such as the RTX 4080, while offering comparable overall performance.

PLEASE REVIEW","['This morning is an important one for AMD – perhaps the most important of the year. After almost a year and a half of build-up, and even longer for actual development, AMD is launching their next generation GPU/APU/AI accelerator family, the Instinct MI300 series. Based on AMD\'s new CDNA 3 architecture, and combining it with AMD\'s proven Zen 4 cores, AMD will be making a full-court press for the high-end GPU and accelerator market with their new product, aiming to lead in both big-metal HPC as well as the burgeoning market for generative AI training and inference.\n\nTaking the stage for AMD\'s launch event will be AMD CEO Dr. LIsa Su, as well as a numerous AMD executives and ecosystem partners, to detail, at last, AMD\'s latest generation GPU architecture, and the many forms it will come in. With both the MI300X accelerator and MI300A APU, AMD is aiming to cover most of the accelerator market, whether clients just need a powerful GPU or a tightly-coupled GPU/CPU pairing.\n\nThe stakes for today\'s announcement are significant. The market for generative AI is all but hardware constrained at the moment, much to the benefit of (and profits for) AMD\'s rival NVIDIA. So AMD is hoping to capitalize on this moment to cut off a piece – perhaps a very big piece – of the market for generative AI accelerators. AMD has made breaking into the server space their highest priority over the last half-decade, and now, they believe, is their time to take a big piece of the server GPU market.\n\n12:56PM EST - We\'re here in San Jose for AMD\'s final and most important launch event of the year: Advancing AI\n\n12:57PM EST - Today AMD is making the eagerly anticipated launch of their next-generation MI300 series of accelerators\n\n12:58PM EST - Including MI300A, their first chiplet-based server APU, and MI300X, their stab at the most powerful GPU/accelerator possible for the AI market\n\n12:59PM EST - I\'d say the event is being held in AMD\'s backyard, but since AMD sold their campus here in the bay area several years ago, this is more like NVIDIA\'s backyard.

 'Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Revenue Recognition Revenue Allowances For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development Arrangements Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.

Compute grew 266% due to higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform for the training and inference of LLMs, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. Networking was up 133% due to higher shipments of InfiniBand. Graphics revenue &#8211; The year-on-year increase was led by growth in Gaming of 15% driven by higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels. Reportable segment operating income &#8211; The year-on-year increase in Compute &#38; Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue. All Other operating loss - The year-on-year decrease was due to the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a $839 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2024.

 'Update on June 27, 2023 at 7:30 AM PT:\n\nWe’re excited to begin rolling out Meta Verified to most markets globally over the coming months.\n\nWe’ve heard positive feedback from creators in our initial tests and continue to gather input about what’s most valuable for subscribers. We’ll continue to evolve Meta Verified based on these learnings and explore new features and benefits that create more value for subscribers.\n\nUpdate on June 7, 2023 at 7:30 AM PT:\n\nMeta Verified is now available in India and will soon be available in Brazil.\n\nUpdate on May 31, 2023 at 9:00 AM PT:\n\nMeta Verified is now available in Canada.\n\nUpdate on May 16, 2023 at 7:40 AM PT:\n\nMeta Verified is now available in the United Kingdom.\n\nUpdate on March 17, 2023 at 11 AM PT:\n\nWe’re expanding our test of Meta Verified to the US after seeing good results from our early testing. This test in the US will reflect some initial learnings and feedback. We’re removing increased reach as a subscription feature for now, as we gather more feedback and further evolve Meta Verified. We’re exploring elements to add to the subscription as we roll out to more places and will share more when we’re ready.\n\nOriginally published on February 19, 2023 at 12 PM PT:\n\nTo help up-and-coming creators grow their presence and build community faster, today Mark Zuckerberg announced that we’ll begin testing a new offering called Meta Verified, a subscription bundle on Instagram and Facebook that includes a verified badge that authenticates your account with government ID, proactive account protection, access to account support, and increased visibility and reach. We’re starting with a gradual test in Australia and New Zealand later this week to learn what’s most valuable, and we hope to bring Meta Verified to the rest of the world soon.\n\nSome of the top requests we get from creators are for broader access to verification and account support, in addition to more features to increase visibility and reach. Since last year, we’ve been thinking about how to unlock access to these features through a paid offering.\n\nWith Meta Verified, you’ll get:\n\nA verified badge, confirming you’re the real you and that your account has been authenticated with a government ID.¹\n\nMore protection from impersonation with proactive account monitoring for impersonators who might target people with growing online audiences.\n\nHelp when you need it with access to a real person for common account issues.\n\nIncreased visibility and reach with prominence in some areas of the platform– like search, comments and recommendations.²\n\nExclusive features to express yourself in unique ways.³\n\nMeta Verified is available for direct purchase on Instagram or Facebook in Australia and New Zealand starting later this week. People can purchase a monthly subscription for (USD) $11.99 on the web and (USD) $14.99 on iOS and Android.4\n\nAs we test and learn, there will be no changes to accounts on Instagram and Facebook that are already verified based on prior requirements. Long term, we want to build a subscription offering that’s valuable to everyone, including creators, businesses and our community at large. As part of this vision, we are evolving the meaning of verified accounts on our apps so we can expand access to verification and more people can trust the accounts they interact with are authentic.\n\nBuilding Safety from the Beginning\n\nIt’s important to feel confident that your identity and accounts are safe and that the people you’re interacting with are who they say they are. That’s why we’re building a series of checks into Meta Verified before, during, and after someone applies.\n\nTo be eligible, accounts must meet minimum activity requirements, such as prior posting history, and be at least 18 years old .\n\nApplicants are then required to submit a government ID that matches the profile name and photo of the Facebook or Instagram account they’re applying for .\n\nSubscriptions will include proactive monitoring for account impersonation.\n\nWe’re also committed to continuous monitoring and review of reported violations, as well as taking swift action against those who try to evade our systems.\n\nTo learn more about Meta Verified visit Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta Channel on Instagram on your mobile device.\n\n1. Where available, some subscribers may be required to submit a selfie video as part of the authentication process.\n\n2. We’ll offer exclusive stickers on Facebook and Instagram Stories and Facebook Reels, and 100 free stars a month on Facebook so you can show your support for other creators.\n\n3. AUD 19.99 on web, AUD 24.99 on iOS and Android. NZD 23.99 on web, NZD 29.99 on iOS and Android. Subscription features are the same for both web and app purchases.\n\n4. Businesses are not eligible to apply for Meta Verified at this time.'
 ""We offer tuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications. We implemented a career coaching service to provide one-on-one guidance to employees, and encourage internal job mobility. We have implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and employees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement. To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party platform. Pulse surveys help us gain insight into employee experience and provides employee-generated ideas so that we can take targeted action. The suggestion box is an always-on, interactive tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses. We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come and stay. In fiscal year 2024, our overall turnover rate was 2.7%. Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company&#8217;s future. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees&#8217; and their families&#8217; physical health, well-being, and financial health. Programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off policies to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide comparable support across the regions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on the needs of our Community Resource Groups and continuing our support for parents, both new birth parents and those who wish to become parents. Our support is enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic volatility, to take care of our existing team of world-class talent and their families. Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees. When recruiting for new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that includes those underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino candidates. To this end, we have been: &#8226; Partnering with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities; &#8226; Embedding dedicated recruiting teams to business areas to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and find internal opportunities; &#8226; Supporting the development of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of future leaders; &#8226; Providing peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups; &#8226; Providing training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments and recruiting for diversity; &#8226; Track equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee engagement scores; and &#8226; Measuring year over year progress and providing leadership visibility on diversity efforts. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, our global workforce was 79% male, 20% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our workforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees. Flexible Working Environment We support a flexible work environment, understanding that many employees want the ability to work from home under certain conditions. This flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention, and employee engagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA a great place to work. During fiscal year 2025, we will continue to have a flexible work environment and maintain our company wide 2-days off a quarter for employees to rest and recharge.

 'In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.\n\nWith such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\n\nAt a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P/S. Thus, it looks much more reasonably valued than NVIDIA, especially considering its five-year mean P/S of eight. However, a neutral view might be appropriate in the near term due to the geopolitical overhang for Taiwanese stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enjoyed a nice 11% lift over the last five days due to NVIDIA’s good news, enjoying their best week in almost a year. TSM is likely to see some sales increase from the AI transition because it manufactures NVIDIA’s chips, but any impact is likely to be modest.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could face issues amid the growing tensions between Taiwan and China, which convinced Warren Buffett to dump most of his $4.1 billion stake after less than a year. Given Buffett’s long-term focus, it’s highly unusual that he would sell the position after holding it for such a short time.\n\nThus, while Taiwan Semiconductor could end up being an excellent long-term investment at current prices, the recent rally paired with the geopolitical tensions suggests a neutral view for now.\n\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sells assigned over the last three months. At $118.67, the average Taiwan Semiconductor stock price target implies upside potential of 19.93%.\n\nConclusion: Bearish on NVDA, Neutral on TSM\n\nNVIDIA and TSM clearly have excellent long-term prospects, given their AI exposure. However, it seems like buying NVIDIA shares at current prices could be playing with fire, given its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price.\n\nTSM’s valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI, but the geopolitical overhang adds significant risk to owning the shares.\n\nDisclosure'
 'Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said on Tuesday that it planned to lay off about 10,000 employees, or roughly 13 percent of its work force, the latest move to hew to what the company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has called a “year of efficiency.”\n\nThe layoffs will affect Meta’s recruiting team this week, with a restructuring of its tech and business groups to come in April and May, Mr. Zuckerberg said in a memo posted on the company’s website. The announcement is the company’s second round of cuts within the past half year. In November, Meta laid off more than 11,000 people, or about 13 percent of its work force at the time.\n\nMeta also plans to close about 5,000 job postings that have yet to be filled, Mr. Zuckerberg said in the memo. Other restructuring efforts include a plan to wrap up this summer an analysis of Meta’s hybrid return-to-office model, which it began testing last March.\n\n“This will be tough and there’s no way around that,” he wrote.\n\nMeta’s stock rose more than 7 percent by the close of trading on Tuesday.']","Meta is reducing its workforce by about 10,000 employees and closing 5,000 unfilled job postings to streamline operations, while NVIDIA has launched the RTX 4090D, a China-specific gaming chip compliant with U.S. export restrictions, and is capitalizing on the generative AI technology boom, expecting significant revenue growth in Q4 fiscal 2024.",176,0.32499999998375,0.7272727272727273,0.842399331582197,0.3333333333333333,0.16666666652777776

PLEASE REVIEW","['Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Revenue Recognition Revenue Allowances For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances. We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development Arrangements Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes. We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting Estimate In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share. Results of Operations A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 24, 2023, which is available free of charge on the SEC&#8217;s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.

Compute grew 266% due to higher shipments of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform for the training and inference of LLMs, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. Networking was up 133% due to higher shipments of InfiniBand. Graphics revenue &#8211; The year-on-year increase was led by growth in Gaming of 15% driven by higher sell-in to partners following the normalization of channel inventory levels. Reportable segment operating income &#8211; The year-on-year increase in Compute &#38; Networking and Graphics operating income was driven by higher revenue. All Other operating loss - The year-on-year decrease was due to the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a $839 million increase in stock-based compensation expense in fiscal year 2024.

 'Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (&#8220;SA&#8221;). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 &#8211; Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. PART II Item 8 &#160; Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.

 'In this piece, I evaluated two chipmaker stocks, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), using TipRanks’ comparison tool to determine which is better. Both have skyrocketed this year, although NVIDIA is outperforming most, if not all, other stocks on U.S. exchanges, gaining 180% year-to-date. Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor is up a mere 38% year-to-date.\n\nWith such massive gains, a closer look is needed to determine whether there could be any more upside left. For comparison, the U.S. semiconductor industry is trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40.6 versus its three-year average of 27.1. The industry is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.7 versus the three-year average of 5.6.\n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA)\n\nAt a P/E of 208.5 and a P/S of 38.3, NVIDIA initially looks massively overvalued versus its industry. However, the chipmaker’s five-year mean P/E is about 66.7, while its five-year mean P/S is about 17.7, showing that it typically trades far above its industry. Nonetheless, it seems clear from the headlines about NVIDIA that it’s in a bubble, suggesting a bearish view might be appropriate for now.\n\nThis year’s massive rally in NVIDIA shares has made the company into the next $1 trillion company, joining the few blockbuster Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft in the over-$1 trillion-market-capitalization club. However, that rally also suggests NVIDIA could be a bubble stock, and if there’s one thing all investors know about asset bubbles, it’s that they pop — eventually.\n\nNVIDIA skyrocketed nearly 30% just in the last five days to hit a new record high of about $419 after reporting a 21% year-over-year increase in net income for the first quarter. Management also used a key phrase in their earnings commentary that helped drive that massive rally: “generative AI.”\n\nThe hype over artificial intelligence this year — likely stemming from the release of ChatGPT — has boosted the shares of virtually every company that has anything to do with AI. In his earnings commentary, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted that $1 trillion worth of installed global data infrastructure “will transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service, and business process.”\n\nNotably, NVIDIA’s data-center revenue surged to a record $4.28 billion in the first quarter. While the chipmaker is and will continue to be a winner in the AI race, euphoria doesn’t last forever, and the shares have flattened out after their initial earnings-related surge.\n\nIn fact, insiders have unloaded almost $8 million worth of NVIDIA shares over the last three months, and the rally over the last five days suggests more sales could be reported soon.\n\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nNVIDIA has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 33 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $441.84, the average NVIDIA stock price target implies an upside potential of 15.47%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM)\n\nAt a P/E of 15.5 and a P/S of 6.4, Taiwan Semiconductor trades at a discount to its industry P/E and in line with its industry P/S. Thus, it looks much more reasonably valued than NVIDIA, especially considering its five-year mean P/S of eight. However, a neutral view might be appropriate in the near term due to the geopolitical overhang for Taiwanese stocks.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has enjoyed a nice 11% lift over the last five days due to NVIDIA’s good news, enjoying their best week in almost a year. TSM is likely to see some sales increase from the AI transition because it manufactures NVIDIA’s chips, but any impact is likely to be modest.\n\nUnfortunately, the company could face issues amid the growing tensions between Taiwan and China, which convinced Warren Buffett to dump most of his $4.1 billion stake after less than a year. Given Buffett’s long-term focus, it’s highly unusual that he would sell the position after holding it for such a short time.\n\nThus, while Taiwan Semiconductor could end up being an excellent long-term investment at current prices, the recent rally paired with the geopolitical tensions suggests a neutral view for now.\n\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on four Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sells assigned over the last three months. At $118.67, the average Taiwan Semiconductor stock price target implies upside potential of 19.93%.\n\nConclusion: Bearish on NVDA, Neutral on TSM\n\nNVIDIA and TSM clearly have excellent long-term prospects, given their AI exposure. However, it seems like buying NVIDIA shares at current prices could be playing with fire, given its bubble-like aspects that could bring a better entry price.\n\nTSM’s valuation is more attractive and could be a good play on AI, but the geopolitical overhang adds significant risk to owning the shares.\n\nDisclosure'
 'One billion avatars. Yesterday, we got to publicly announce and celebrate that incredible milestone. More than one billion avatars have been created across our technologies. That’s a billion times people have reimagined how they show up online — like showing up to meetings in a suit and tie while wearing pajamas in real life. Respect.\n\nToday, we’re announcing some improvements to Meta Avatars that will help freshen up your look just in time for spring. We’re adding a handful of new avatar body shapes to help you better express yourself — especially if expressing yourself means dancing along to “Hips Don’t Lie.” We’ve also partnered with PUMA to bring seven outfits to the Meta Avatars Store.\n\nAnd we’re continuing to make your avatar look better in smaller and subtler ways as well, because those details help your personality shine through. Literally shine, as we’re adding a bit more sparkle to your eyes, brushing some volume into your hair and making clothes look more realistic and textured. You’ll see these changes when you use your avatar outside of virtual reality (VR).\n\nIntroducing New Body Shapes\n\nEverybody’s different, and every body’s different. Until now, though, the body shape options available when creating your avatar were all pretty similar. Maybe a little rectangular.\n\nWe created them as a good jumping-off point when we launched this iteration of avatars back in 2021. But, we’ve heard feedback that not all of you can see yourselves in the current options.\n\nSo we’re adding more choices, simple as that. Starting this month, you’ll be able to choose from a wider range of body shape options, including two curvier body shapes. We’re refining some of our existing options to help differentiate them as well.\n\nSelf-expression and representation matter — it’s what makes your avatar feel like you — and we’ll continue adding more options over time, working toward a future where everyone can create an avatar they love.\n\nNew PUMA Looks\n\nLast year we introduced the Avatars Store, a one-stop shop for customizing your avatar across Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and in VR. Since launch, we’ve brought in outfits from some of the world’s leading fashion, sports, and lifestyle brands — including Madhappy, the NBA, Prada and Thom Browne.\n\nAdd PUMA to the list. We’ve partnered with the sports brand to offer seven of its lifestyle looks starting May 1.\n\nHair and Clothing Textures\n\nLastly, we’ve overhauled how your avatar’s hair, clothing and eyes appear in stickers, profile pictures, cover photos and more.\n\nSparing you the nitty-gritty technical breakdown, we’ve added additional detail and realism to both hair and clothing — meaning whether you’re rocking a clean fade and suit or bedhead and sweats, your avatar should pop a little better than before. Solid glow-up, right? We’ve also tweaked our lighting model to add a little more of a reflective gleam to your eyes, making them sparkle and bring your personality to life.\n\nKeep an eye out for more changes. We have a lot of improvements coming to avatars this year, and we can’t wait to share more!\n\nAs a reminder, when you create an avatar and share it across our technologies it will be public to other people.
